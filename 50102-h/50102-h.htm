 <h2 id='chI'>CHAPTER I.—ALL READY FOR THE AMAZON</h2>

<p class='first'>The opening of a door cast an oblong shape of
light over the forward deck of a motor boat, against
which an April rain drummed fast or slow, as the
uncertain wind came in swift gusts or died down to
whispers. As the illumination traveled past the
splashed deck, bringing out a pier and a warehouse,
and a sluggish current pushing and fussing against
the piles of a pier farther down, the tousled heads
of two boys appeared outlined against the ruddy
doorway. In a moment their voices cut through
the wind and rain.</p>

<p>“Jule? Oh, Jule!” one of them shouted.</p>

<p>“Last call for dinner in the main cabin, young
man!” added the other.</p>

<p>There was no reply, so the boys, after listening
a moment to the pounding of the rain, the complaining
of the river, the roar of the city which lay all
around them, closed the door, producing the effect
to one outside of obliterating the deck and the
pier, the warehouse and the river, as if they had
never existed at all.</p>

<p>“Jule will get soaking wet and take cold!”
fretted a third voice as the door closed. “Besides,
being on guard, he ought never to have left the
boat!”</p>

<p>One of the boys who had stood in the doorway
wiped the rain from his face as he listened and
grinned at the other.</p>

<p>“No need to have a fit about it, even if Jule does
get soaked,” he said. “But he won’t get wet,” he
added, entirely for the benefit of the one who
had grumbled, “he’ll be back here in a minute as
dry as a pound of powder.”</p>

<p>“How’s he going to get through all that,” with
a swing of the arm toward the door, “without getting
wet? I suppose you think he’ll be able to dodge
the drops!”</p>

<p>“Anyway, what’s the use of getting him wet
and sick in our minds?” cut in another,
good-naturedly. “That won’t help any. Most of the
hard luck we’ve had lately never caught up with
us—except in our minds!”</p>

<p>“Case”—Cornelius Witters where full names
are insisted on—turned a dejected face to the others.</p>

<p>“He shouldn’t have gone out,” he grumbled.</p>

<p>“Speaking of hard luck that never caught up
with us,” said Clay—he had inherited from his
parents, his only inheritance, by the way, the name
of Gayton Emmett—“do you remember the time
we lost $50 by taking in a counterfeit bill?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” laughed Alex—Alexander Smithwick
on state occasions—“we lost the $50 for one day
and one night, until we could get to a bank.
Then it wasn’t lost at all, for the note was genuine!
You know the story how a man hired a professional
worrier to take trouble off his mind? Suppose we
hire one? I reckon he’d have enough to do.”</p>

<p>“Quit, boys!” Case broke in. “I know I’ve
got a grouch a mile high to-night, but I’ll soon
recover. Wait until I get busy with the supper we’re
going to have, and you’ll see!”</p>

<p>Case seemed ashamed of his complaining, so the
boys silently accepted his implied apology and
busied themselves preparing the supper he had
spoken of. In the eyes of the lads that was Case’s
one fault. He was inclined to worry, and also to
express his worries in the most depressing
prophecies. But while they laughed at his premonition
of trouble for the absent boy, they listened anxiously
for the absent one’s return.</p>

<p>Directly Clay took a handful of silver from a
pocket and laid it in a shining heap on the table.</p>

<p>“I guess we’d better cash up,” he said. “I got
my last pay envelope from Slade &amp; Co., to-day, and
here’s the coin. We must have more than $200 by
this time.”</p>

<p>The other boys drew banknotes and silver from
their pockets, and heaped their contributions on the
table.</p>

<p>“Now, we’ll put it with the other,” Clay said,
after it had been counted over at least half a dozen
times. “Just where is our bank to-night? I don’t
seem to remember where we deposited last time.”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t in a bank,” Case broke in, forgetting
his promise to get rid of his grouch, “though it
should have been. The idea of leaving $200 lying
loose in this old tub!”</p>

<p>“Now you’re losing our money—in your mind!”
laughed Clay. “How many times before to-night
have you lost it, Case?”</p>

<p>“Well, it isn’t safe, anyhow,” insisted Case,
“even with Jule here to watch it; and he runs out
and leaves the boat alone after dark!”</p>

<p>“When will this professional worrier begin
work?” asked Alex with a sly grin at Clay. “He’s
needed here right now. Case doesn’t seem to be
able to acquire any peace of mind!”</p>

<p>Case blushed, as if ashamed of his outburst so
soon after having resolved to mend his ways, and
moved toward the back of the cabin.</p>

<p>“I don’t know just where Jule put the money
last time we counted it,” he said, making a great
show of looking for it, “but I presume it is here
somewhere.”</p>

<p>In fumbling around next to the rear wall the boy
came upon a roll of drawings, which he brought out
and tossed on the table, his quest of the hidden
money momentarily forgotten.</p>

<p>“Here’s the map of the Amazon, boys,” he said,
unrolling the paper. “I brought it in to-night. As
we leave to-morrow, we may as well run over it
now. Here’s where we strike the Brazilian coast,
at Para, and here’s where we camp on the Amazon,
away up near the foothills of the Eastern Andes. I
guess Jule will get well up there!”</p>

<p>“Of course he will!” Clay asserted. “Didn’t
Dr. Holcomb say so? I guess he knows.”</p>

<p>“He’s a brick, that Dr. Holcomb!” Alex declared.
“Only for him we wouldn’t be so near the
roof of the world as we are now.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see any roof of any world!” observed
Case, obstinately.</p>

<p>“You will if you stick with us,” Alex continued.
“The mountains and tablelands of South America,
along there by Peru, you know, are often called the
roof of the world. When you get up to the top of
some of the mountains, you can’t get any higher in
this world, without going up in an aeroplane, and
then you wouldn’t be in the world at all, but out of
it and above it.”</p>

<p>“Well, we aren’t very near it yet,” Case replied.</p>

<p>“But we will be nearer it, physically, to-morrow
night at this time,” Alex kept on. “Think of it!
Through the drainage canal like an arrow in
this good little motor boat, down the Mississippi
with a rush, into the Gulf of Mexico and the
Caribbean sea and out again, and then along the coast to
the mouth of the Amazon! Say, boys, do you know
that the Amazon has a mouth a hundred and fifty
miles wide?”</p>

<p>“What a campaign orator she would have
made!” laughed Clay. “But, suppose we find the
money before we look over the map.”</p>

<p>The motor boat <i>Rambler</i> lay in a secluded
warehouse slip in the South Branch, as the southwestern
arm of the Chicago river is called, and the three
hungry boys referred to and one other, Julian
Shafer, the lad the others were now anxious about,
constituted her crew and passenger list, all in one.
Clay, Alex and Case were busy with supper
arrangements, as stated, and all were listening for the
approach of Jule.</p>

<p>The cabin, which was seven feet by nine, did not
seem quite like home without him. The rain, which
had come on with the going down of the sun, drove
in spiteful gusts from the southwest, so that the two
foot-square windows on that side were closed, but
from the open casements to the north the odor of
sizzling sausage and bubbling coffee traveled out on
the wet winds of the April evening.</p>

<p>Many who passed the head of the driveway which
led down to the warehouse and the pier where the
<i>Rambler</i> lay stopped to sniff the fragrant reminder
of what the world owes to its stomach, and to look in
wonder at the odd little residence on the brown river.</p>

<p>A patrolman, rustling along in a rubber coat which
came down to his great heels, swinging his
nightstick petulantly, as if in protest of the storm, drew
up at the entrance to the private way and glanced
down at the boat and stood for an instant imagining
how a good cup of that coffee would taste!</p>

<p>It was while he stood there that the door was
opened, and it was while the light from the interior
lay over the pier and warehouse that the officer
thought he saw a slim figure skulking in an angle
of the building. When he reached the place where
the figure had stood, the light was gone and the
angle was empty, with the rain beating against it
in a particularly determined manner. So the
policeman went on about his business.</p>

<p>The <i>Rambler</i> had lain in the slip by the
warehouse all through the winter, and the boys had
called her cabin, which was so low that they could
stand upright only in the center, their “furnished,
steam-heated apartments,” being careful to speak
of it in the plural. She was a trim little craft,
twenty feet by seven over all, with the cabin
extending over almost half of the interior of the
shell, lengthwise.</p>

<p>The cabin was a strongly-built structure, with
two foot-square windows on each side and one
looking out at the stern, where a platform four feet by
the width of the boat formed a floor for chairs, and
also a covering for the gasoline tanks underneath.
The front deck extended to the prow, the powerful
motors and other machinery being mostly under it,
near the middle of the craft, just in front of the
cabin door. Under this deck, forward of the
motors and apparatus for supplying electricity, were
storage spaces for provisions and gasoline.</p>

<p>As has, perhaps, been gathered from the
conversation engaged in by the occupants of the cabin on
this night, the boys had arranged to take their
winter “bachelor hall” out on a long journey
during the summer. They were now ready to start on
the trip they had long planned—no less an
undertaking than a motor boat journey to the headwaters
of the Amazon! In fact, the boat was already
stocked with provisions, and the gasoline was to be
taken on the next day.</p>

<p>The boys were all orphans, so far as they knew,
having been in the first instance brought together by
their homelessness. They had been reared in the
streets of the city, selling newspapers and running
errands and doing such odd jobs as boys can turn
hand to. Often, when very young, they had slept
together in hallways and in boxes in alleys. When
arrived at the age of fourteen, they had secured
employment in printing offices, and had of their own
volition become regular attendants at night schools.</p>

<p>There are to-day thousands of boys in the large
cities who are living just as these boys lived in their
younger years, who sleep and eat where and when
they can, and who are too often brought into crime
by those who ought to teach them, from experience,
that crime is never pleasant or profitable in the
long run. Sometimes the law, in the guise of a
fat-bellied, egotistical, greedy police officer, assists these
wreckers of youth by arresting boys and seeing that
they are sentenced to months of association with
thieves.</p>

<p>These four boys, the three in the cabin and the
one out somewhere in the rain, had fortunately been
spared the attentions of police officers, and had
grown to the age of seventeen with sturdy figures
and fairly-well trained intellects—all save Julian
Shafer, who had long been showing symptoms of
tuberculosis.</p>

<p>It was the ill health of Jule that had at first
suggested the trip to the Equator. The boy, ordinarily
the merriest one of the lot, as full of pranks as a
young kitten, had been informed by Dr. Holcomb
that the climate of Chicago would bring his life to
a close in two years’ time, so the boys had planned
to take him away. Unselfishly they had set their
hands to the task, and now the first step was near
completion.</p>

<p>It was while they were cudgeling their brains
for some way of accomplishing the desire of their
hearts that Dr. Holcomb had come to them, first as
a physician for the ailing boy, then as a sincere
friend. After becoming well acquainted with the
lads, and after making a few investigations as to
their habits of thought, their loyalty to each other,
the good doctor had said to them, one bright night
in early fall when they were assembled in his office:</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what, boys,” he had begun, “I have
a motor boat down in the South Branch which is of
little use to me. I used to enjoy trips in her, and
she has seen service on many of the lakes and rivers
of the Northwest, but I’m too busy now to take the
time to flirt with her. If you care to look after her
this winter, fix her up a little, and in the spring
provision her for a journey to some tropical climate,
you may have the use of her. What do you say?”</p>

<p>What did they say! What would any group of
boys of seventeen say to such a proposition as that?
They almost hugged the doctor, and the occupants
of the other offices on that floor afterward
complained that the doctor’s patients were too noisy to
be good pay! As for Jule, when he understood that
it was all being done for him, he said nothing at
all, but there was a moisture in his bright eyes, a
tightening of his handclasp that night, which his
chums understood.</p>

<p>“But you must save up at least $200,” the doctor
had stipulated, “for I don’t care to have the
<i>Rambler</i> tied up in some foreign port for
supply or repair bills. She will carry you anywhere,
on ocean or river, if you learn how to handle her, and
you needn’t be afraid of being caught by anything of her
size in a chase. Be good to her and she’ll be good
to you!”</p>

<p>So the boys had slept and cooked for themselves
in the <i>Rambler</i> all that winter, to save more money,
and had learned to run the boat, and had made many
little repairs with their own hands. And now they
had saved the sum required, had given up their
positions, and were to sail away to the Amazon and the
Andes on the morrow! It all seemed too good to
be true!”</p>

<p>“The money,” Clay said, after looking over the
map, “is, I remember now, in the round box, with
the tinned food, in a square box with a red cover.
Get it, Alex.”</p>

<p>Alex brought the box—and found it empty. The
money was gone!</p>
 </div>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chII'>CHAPTER II.—A CALL FROM THE DARKNESS</h2>

<p class='first'>Yes, the hoarded money was gone!</p>

<p>The square box with the red cover was empty.
The boys dropped back in their chairs and turned
their eyes away, neither caring to read what was in
the faces opposite. The money that had been ready
for the hoard still lay on the table. Case was first
to break the silence.</p>

<p>“Our professional worry man,” he said, “would
better start on his job to-night. He’ll have a nice
little task to begin on.”</p>

<p>“Don’t get sarcastic, Case,” Clay remonstrated.
“This may be one of the worries that won’t catch
up! Perhaps Jule has placed the money in a safer
place.”</p>

<p>“That’s it!” cried Alex. “Of course that’s it!
Who would come in here and get our money?”</p>

<p>“Then, where is Jule?” demanded the boy
addressed. “Why doesn’t he come in and let us know
where the money is?</p>

<p>“Jule will be home in good time,” Clay said,
grimly, “and for the present it won’t be healthy
for anyone to suggest that he has done anything
mean or dishonest. He’ll be back, all right, and then
we’ll know all about it.”</p>

<p>Case flushed furiously.</p>

<p>“Say,” he expostulated, “I wasn’t saying
anything against Jule! At least I didn’t mean to. I
know that he’s true blue. Perhaps he discovered the
robbery before we did and chased off after the thief.
Don’t you ever think I’m blaming him!”</p>

<p>“Of course not,” admitted Clay, doubtfully.
“He’s above anything of that kind, you know. He’s
as honest a boy as ever lived!”</p>

<p>“If he has put the money in another place,”
began Alex, but Case, still in bad humor, interrupted
him.</p>

<p>“What a pleasant world this would be if there
were no if words in it! Someone said, not long
ago, that if it wasn’t for that word he could put Paris
in a bottle! He meant, of course, if Paris was
smaller or the bottle was larger. If he has put the
money in another place!”</p>

<p>“I wonder why he doesn’t come?” Alex put in.
“We left him here to look after things, you know.”</p>

<p>“He wasn’t here when I came,” Clay contributed.
“Everything was just as you see it now, only there
wasn’t any supper cooking, as there is now. He
never went off like this before.”</p>

<p>There was an apparatus on board the <i>Rambler</i> for
making electricity when the boat was under way, but,
this being inoperative during the winter, the boys
had caused the motor boat to be wired so the light
came from the city lines. The cooking was partly
done by electricity, the stove being concealed in a
false couch at the back of the cabin. During the cold
weather the cabin had been warmed by a tiny, soft-coal
stove which now stood near the door, and some
of the cooking had been done on that.</p>

<p>A smell of burning meat now filled the room, and
Clay hastened to switch off the current. The
coffee, neglected, was bubbling over on the coils of wire
at the bottom of the stove, and he set the coffee-pot
on the floor.</p>

<p>“I don’t think I want any supper right now,” he
declared.</p>

<p>“I’m not going to lose my supper,” argued Alex.
“I’ve lost my job and my trip to the Amazon, but
I’m not going to lose my supper. These sausages
are all right yet.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t lost my trip to the Amazon,” Clay
gritted, his jaws setting. “Nor Jule hasn’t lost his
trip, or his one chance of life! I’ll have to think out
some way, but I’m going, and Jule’s going with
me!”</p>

<p>Alex and Case both sprang up and reached for
the speaker’s hands.</p>

<p>“And we’re with you!” they cried.</p>

<p>“We’re for the Amazon, too! No matter if I do
get a grouch on now and then,” Case continued,
giving the hand he held an extra squeeze, “I’ll show
up right in the end!”</p>

<p>“I know you will,” Clay said. “I know you’re
an all right boy, Case, he continued, “but you’d be
a better companion if you wouldn’t get such
grouches!”</p>

<p>“If I ever get another,” pleaded the boy, “just
throw me out of the combination!”</p>

<p>“I’ll set my white monkey on you, after we get
into the jungles of the Amazon valley,” laughed
Alex. “Do you know I’ve got a white monkey
there?” he added, with a look which he intended to
be serious. “Surely I have! He’ll throw Brazil
nuts down to me. Do you know how Brazil nuts
grow? I’ll tell you. They grow in nests, like
kittens, and when they get ripe the nest opens, just
like a kitten basket, and there you are. The nuts
fall to the ground and hunters gather them and
bring them to Chicago and we put them on
Christmas trees.”</p>

<p>Alex was the most imaginative one of the party,
and sometimes he permitted his quaint fancies to
break into words. Just now he was doing his best
to seem cheerful, but, after all, it was hard work.
The money had meant so much to them. It had been
gathered together dime by dime, and every dollar
of it had meant, to them, an hour or a day on the
Amazon. Now it was gone, and Jule——</p>

<p>But no one should say a word against Jule. That
was a point settled beyond dispute. They could
suspend judgment until he came back.</p>

<p>“I’m going to bring home a cargo of Brazil
nuts,” the boy went on, “all packed in an elephant’s
trunk. I’ll sell ’em down on Water street and build
a motor boat that can put the <i>Rambler</i> into her
pocket. I wonder what Dr. Holcomb will say?”</p>

<p>“He’ll just tell us to dig in and get more money!”
Case observed.</p>

<p>“And that’s just what we’ll do,” Clay added.
Alex brought out plates and cups and began
setting the table, which was not very large, and which
was securely fastened to the floor in the center of
the cabin.</p>

<p>“There’s one thing lacking in Clay,” the boy said,
whimsically, as he rattled the dishes. “If you could
take him apart, or look at him under x-rays, you
wouldn’t find any quit in him! The more things
happen to stop him, the more he goes ahead!”</p>

<p>“That’s right!” declared Case. “When I get
grouches, and you get all discouraged and tell
monkey stories to hide what’s really in your mind,
Clay just shuts his jaws together and goes right
through! I guess this wouldn’t be much of a boat
club if it wasn’t for Clay.”</p>

<p>“Why, boys, there’s nothing else to do in this
case,” Clay said, a flush of pleasure at such an
endorsement. “We can’t lie down before every little
hill that looms up before us! We can’t give up this
trip, and leave Jule to die in this beastly climate.
Now, can we?”</p>

<p>“Not in a thousand years!” cried Alex.</p>

<p>“That will do for you!” Case suggested, turning
to Alex with a grin.</p>

<p>“Never said it!” insisted Alex. “We all agreed
not to talk slang, so slang’s cut out!”</p>

<p>“Slang is cheap,” Clay remarked, to no one in
particular.</p>

<p>“Alex will wash the dishes to-night, anyway, for
talking slang!” Case decreed with the air of a
judge sentencing a prisoner. “That was the
bargain. If anyone talked slang he was to wash the
dishes.”</p>

<p>“And Case will assist,” laughed Clay, “for he
talked slang, too.”</p>

<p>“What slang?” demanded Case.</p>

<p>“You said that will do for you, and that was
slang!”</p>

<p>“All right! I’ll help. But where do you think Jule is?</p>

<p>He was about to say more, but Clay held up a
hand for silence.</p>

<p>While the lads stood there, listening, the sausages
and coffee on the table, over which a snow-white
cloth had been spread, there came a choking cry
from somewhere in the darkness which lay over the
pier and the warehouse. The boys still listened.
Perhaps the next cry would give direction.</p>

<p>Presently the cry came again, evidently from the
head of the pier. The boys all headed for the door,
crowding against each other in their efforts to get
out. A third cry, which was almost a scream,
caused them to block the doorway.</p>

<p>“That’s Jule!” Case panted. “Let me out!”</p>

<p>“Wait a second, boys!” Clay advised. “That
may be Jule, and it may not. Anyway, we mustn’t
all leave the boat at once. This may be a trick to
get us away from it. You remain here and I’ll go up
the pier and call back to you if I need help.”</p>

<p>Still another cry came, followed, this time, by the
sound of blows and running feet.</p>

<p>“Someone is being murdered out there!” Case
exclaimed, excitedly, as Clay dashed out into the
rain. “I’m not going to stay inside and let someone
be killed!”</p>

<p>Alex took him by the shoulder and drew him back
as he started off.</p>

<p>“You’ll obey orders and remain here,” he said.
“We can stand in the doorway and look out.”</p>

<p>“I know it’s Jule!” prophesied Case. “He’s been
out after the thief, and has been attacked. Perhaps
he’s brought the money back with him, and that’s
why they’re attacking him.”</p>

<p>“If it is Jule, and he comes in without mentioning
the loss of the money, don’t you say a word to him
about it! What’s the use, if he doesn’t know, of
telling him about it to-night? Let the kid get one
more night’s sleep before he knows what’s happened!”</p>

<p>“All right,” Case answered, “and perhaps we
can tell by the way he acts whether he’s the—whether
he knows anything about it or not.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you say it!” warned Alex. “Don’t you
ever look at Jule with suspicion in your face! He’s
the one that will lose most by this, and you just
keep your thoughts and your sneers to yourself.”</p>

<p>“I never——”</p>

<p>“Oh, I know,” Alex hastened to say, as they
waited, anxiously, in the doorway, the rain beating
in on their uncovered heads, “I know you don’t
really believe anything wrong about Jule. You’d
fight for him if anyone said there was, just as quick
as I would. It is only your grouchy way of looking
at things. You go and imagine the very worst that
can ever happen, and then try to make yourself
believe that is the way of it!”</p>

<p>Case was about to tell Alex how right he was in
his analysis of his character, how thankful he was
that he was so well understood, when a call came
from some distance up the street.</p>

<p>“That’s Clay!” Alex exclaimed.</p>

<p>“I’m going up there!” insisted Case.</p>

<p>“You’ll stay right here with me and watch,” Alex
declared, taking his uneasy chum by the arm and
holding on tight.</p>

<p>It was dark up at the end of the pier by the side
of which the <i>Rambler</i> lay, but farther up, on the
north and south street which paralleled the river, a
corner lamp threw spears of light toward the
stream.</p>

<p>There was no one in sight. Even what could be
seen of the thoroughfare under the lamp, and this
was not much, seemed deserted. Rainy, windy
nights are not popular with pedestrians in Chicago
any more than elsewhere.</p>

<p>Even the occupants of vessels tied up at piers
above and below the motor boat were silent in
cabins or asleep in their bunks. A dull, heavy roar
came out of the city, telling of activities in the noisy
loop district, but there was little more than the
dash of the rain on the deck where the boys stood
listening and waiting.</p>

<p>Presently they saw a figure detach itself from the
shadows at an angle of the warehouse, where it
seemed to have been hiding, and step into the lighted
space. There it acted queerly, walking up and down,
up and down in the rain! It was too dark for the
boys to see the face.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it is Jule, though,” Case said.</p>
 </div>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chIII'>CHAPTER III.—THE BROWN LEATHER BAG</h2>

<p class='first'>While Alex and Case waited in the doorway,
watching the figure near the warehouse, the circle
of light in the street beyond, the whole gloomy
prospect along the pier, the shrill voice of a police
whistle cut the heavy air. The boys started
nervously.</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t be strange if Clay got into trouble
up there.”</p>

<p>This from Case, who was still in his despondent
mood, and was, as Alex had explained, imagining
the worst and making himself think that was what
was coming!</p>

<p>Alex nudged him with his elbow, in gentle
reminder of his failing, and nodded toward the head
of the pier. Through the falling drops, they saw the
figure which had recently left the shelter of the
warehouse coming toward the boat.</p>

<p>“Whoever it is,” muttered Case, “he’s alarmed at
the police whistle, and is coming down here to hide
away!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Case——”</p>

<p>Alex got no farther with his protest against his
chum’s idle croakings of evil, for the figure was now
almost at the pier, a few yards from the prow of the
<i>Rambler</i>. It was moving slowly, in spite of the
storm beating upon it, hands in pockets, chin buried
in a turned-up coat collar, eyes on the ground.</p>

<p>When almost to the head of the pier the boy, for
such the queer-acting stranger appeared to be, turned
sharply about and went back over the course he had
taken, head down, eyes evidently searching the
ground. This was repeated three times, then the
ring of footsteps above caused him to seek the shelter
of the warehouse again.</p>

<p>Then Clay dashed into view, running at top speed
and bending low as if to better resist the storm, or to
avoid any attack which might be made upon him.
The boys could see the silent figure standing in the
shadow of the warehouse, standing there in a
listening, observant attitude. The thought came to
Alex that this might mean peril to Clay, and so he
called out to warn the skulker that help was at hand.</p>

<p>“Hurry, Clay!” he shouted.</p>

<p>Clay did not reply, but dashed on at increased
speed to the rotting planks of the pier, and was soon
inside the cabin, shaking the rain from his clothes
like a great dog just out of a pond. Alex closed
the door and locked it.</p>

<p>“Did you see Jule?” Case asked, eagerly.</p>

<p>Clay shook his head. His excursion into the
storm had evidently proved a disappointment to
him, but he made an effort not to show it.</p>

<p>“Of course not,” he replied. “How could I
find Jule out in all that smother? He’s warm and
dry somewhere.”</p>

<p>“Did you see the boy skulking by the warehouse
as you came in?” asked Alex. “He’s been there,
watching the boat, ever since you went out.”</p>

<p>Clay shook his head.</p>

<p>“There’s something odd going on around here
to-night,” he said. “I don’t know what to make of
it. Whew, but I’m all out of wind!” he continued,
dropping down into a chair and taking off his
soaked shoes.</p>

<p>“Where did you go?” asked Case. “What was
the cop blowing his whistle for. Why did you
have to run?”</p>

<p>“One at a time,” panted Clay. “When I got out
there I found a man and a boy fighting at the end
of the pier. At any rate the man was trying to get
something away from the boy, and the boy was
letting into him with teeth and nails. The boy was
calling for help. That’s the sound we heard, only
it was faint, on account of the man trying to choke
him.”</p>

<p>“What sort of a boy was it?” asked Case,
thinking of the figure he had seen walking to and fro
under the light and skulking into the shelter of the
warehouse when Clay came running up.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute,” Clay panted, “and I’ll tell you
all about it. Say, who’s going to give a cup of that
hot coffee? My tummy has a hole in it as big as a
rainwater barrel.”</p>

<p>“That’s pretty close to slang!” warned Case.</p>

<p>“Not so you could notice—that is, not intended
as such,” corrected the boy with a grin as he took
a cup of steaming coffee from Alex’s hand and sat
back in his chair with a look of contentment on his
face.</p>

<p>“Now what about it?” asked Alex, when the
cup was empty.</p>

<p>“Well, when I ran up, the man gave a vicious
yank and got something away from the boy. It
looked like, a leather bag. The boy let out a great
cry and fell flat down on his face. I saw his face
just a minute, looking like a snowflake in the mud,
it was so white and so small.</p>

<p>I thought the thing which had been taken from
him must mean a lot, to cause him to look like that,
and so I left him lying there and chased on after
the man. It looked to me like a case of highway
robbery, and I just ached to get my hands on the
man.”</p>

<p>“What is that in your hand?” asked Case,
indicating a brown object which was half concealed in
Clay’s coat-sleeve, but which dropped down to his
palm, and lay with an end resting there.</p>

<p>“Never you mind!” Clay answered, with a
chuckle as he drew the object up the sleeve and out
of sight. “Just wait a minute. I overtook the man,
who couldn’t run at all, but lumbered along like an
old cow, and tripped him up by— Oh, you know
how to drop and catch a fellow by the ankles! He
went down kerflop in the muck, where wagons had
broken the pavement and cut the earth into a puddle.
I didn’t stop to see if he was hurt, but picked up the
thing I had seen him take from the boy and started
back with it.</p>

<p>“When I got back to the place where I had left
the boy, with his pale face in the dirt, he wasn’t
there, so I just brought the object along with me, for
safe keeping, of course,” he added, with a laugh as
he drew a brown leather bag from his sleeve and
held it up to the light.</p>

<p>“That’s certainly a brown leather bag!”
exclaimed Case. “What’s in it?”</p>

<p>“Guess!” was the provoking answer.</p>

<p>“It must be something valuable, with all the fuss
that’s been made over it,” Alex suggested. “Open
up!”</p>

<p>“Do you know what’s in it?” asked Case.</p>

<p>“Of course I do; I peeked in as I came along.”</p>

<p>“Well, what is it?”</p>

<p>“Diamonds!”</p>

<p>“Not real diamonds?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not!” Case ventured. “Just fake
stones, like the glad-hand men carry. They couldn’t
be real diamonds, hustled about in the rain like
this!”</p>

<p>“But they are real diamonds,” insisted Clay. “If
I ever saw the real thing this is it.”</p>

<p>He untied the brown leather bag, pressed open the
mouth with his fingers, and poured a gleaming
current of diamonds on the table, where they rolled
about like sparks of fire caught and held in captivity.
Alex and Case stood dumbly regarding their chum,
moving their eyes, presently, from his inscrutable
face to the gems on the table. This seemed to them
to be a leaf out of a fairy book. It was more
fantastic, more unreal, than one of Alex’s ridiculous
imaginings.</p>

<p>“I wish Jule was here to see ’em!” Clay spoke,
breaking the silence with a long sigh. “He can’t be
long in coming now.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do with them?” asked
Alex.</p>

<p>“First,” Clay answered, gathering up the stones
and looking cautiously about, “I’m going to get
them out of sight! Did you hear that motion at the
door while they lay here sparkling with
a “come-and-get-me” expression?”</p>

<p>“I heard nothing,” Case replied, as Clay put the
gems back in the bag. “Where are you going to
hide them now? You know this isn’t a very safe
treasure house—this old boat.”</p>

<p>“I think I have good reason to know that,”
replied Clay, looking ruefully at the box which had
held the stolen money. “Guess I’ll put them in the
coffee-pot, for the time being. Anybody want any
more?”</p>

<p>Both boys declared they did, naturally! So the
coffee was poured and consumed. Then the pot was
emptied and the brown leather bag was deposited
therein.</p>

<p>“What was it you said about someone being at
the door while the stones were on the table?” asked
Alex.</p>

<p>“Did you see anyone there?” added Case.</p>

<p>For answer Clay nodded his head toward the
single pane in the cabin door, which might have been
a panel of black velvet, so heavily did the darkness
press upon it.</p>

<p>“What did you see there?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Nothing at all.”</p>

<p>Clay moved toward the door and listened between
short steps as he walked.</p>

<p>“If anyone rushes the door,” he said, amazing the
others by the seeming irrelevance of the remark,
“you both stand by to fight ’em off. They will be
after the diamonds—understand. You hold ’em
off and I’ll grab the coffee-pot and run. They will
go away without hurting you when they find out the
gems are not here. After the row is over I’ll come
back.”</p>

<p>“What are you getting at?” demanded Alex.</p>

<p>“You are surely getting ahead of yours truly in the
monkey-story record! Who’s going to rush the
door?”</p>

<p>“Listen!”</p>

<p>As Clay spoke there was a light step on the
deck outside, then a hand crept over the outer
surface of the door and came, fumbling, to the knob,
which turned a fraction of an inch under their eyes.
The lads stood quite still. Clay’s eyes were fixed on
the coffee-pot, now standing within reach of his
hand on the table. Case and Alex were closer to the
door, against which there now came the brushing
of wet garments.</p>

<p>“It may be Jule!” Case whispered.</p>

<p>“No, it is someone after the diamonds!” contended Alex.</p>

<p>There was no farther movement at the door, but
the boys stood in the old positions, ready for
whatever might come.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do with the diamonds?”
asked Case.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know,” Clay answered, almost
fretfully. “I can’t decide on a thing like that in a
second—not right off the handle, you see. I found
them, you know, and——”</p>

<p>“Finders keep and losers seek,” half chanted
Case.</p>

<p>“That’s what’s in my mind,” Clay went on. “I
know that it isn’t just right, but I found them; and,
then, I don’t see no philanthropic person bringing
back our stolen money.”</p>

<p>“No one knows we found them,” Alex suggested.</p>

<p>Then the three boys looked into each other’s eyes
and smiled.</p>

<p>“You know you won’t keep them!” Case declared.
“You know very well that you’ll hunt the
city, or the world, over for the owner if he doesn’t
come after them.”</p>

<p>“You know you never meant to keep them,” Alex
added. “When I hinted that no one knew about
them being here I didn’t mean anything by it. You
know I didn’t.”</p>

<p>“For just a second I meant to keep them,” Clay
confessed. “I was thinking what we might do with
them, you see. If we kept them Jule need never
know about the robbery. He really ought not to
have left the boat, not with all that money here, you
see, and so he’ll blame himself just as much as if
he had taken the money himself. But of course
that was just an impulse. I really don’t mean to
keep them!”</p>

<p>“There’s that hand moving on the door again!”
whispered Alex.</p>

<p>“How do you know it is a hand?” demanded
Case. “It may be the muzzle of a gun or the billy
of a policeman.”</p>

<p>“The only way to find out,” suggested Clay, “is
to open the door and see who’s there.”</p>

<p>Before this intention could be carried out,
however, another element forced itself into the case.
There came a shout from the shore and the sound of
heavy footfalls on the planking of the pier.</p>

<p>“What’s going on here!” demanded a gruff
voice. “What’s all this running round in circles
about?”</p>

<p>There was no answer from the outside, and the
boys in the cabin did not feel qualified to answer any
such questions, so they remained perfectly quiet, until,
in a second, the heavy voice came again.</p>

<p>“Come out of that, you wharf rat!” it said.
“Come out where I can see you.”</p>

<p>“That’s a member of the river police,” Clay
suggested. “They always talk about wharf rats.”</p>

<p>“Who is he talking to?” queried Case, puzzled.
“The person on our deck, whoever he is,” Clay
decided.</p>

<p>Then the nervous sounds on the door continued,
and a voice said:</p>

<p>“Will you let me in, please?”</p>

<p>“Sounds like a girl’s voice.”</p>

<p>This from Alex, who stepped forward as he
spoke.</p>

<p>“Perhaps it is the boy I saw fighting the man on
the pier,” Clay suggested. “He looked pale and
sick, and that voice doesn’t belong to a healthy
boy.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid of the police!” came the voice again.
“Please let me in. I’ll go away as soon as they are
gone.”</p>

<p>“Anyway,” Clay decided, “risk or no risk,
diamonds or no diamonds, I’m going to open the door
and let him in!”</p>

<p>“Surely,” echoed Alex, with a grin. “Let him
in. We’ve been chased by the river police, ourselves,
before now.”</p>

<p>“Do you think the policeman saw you get the
brown leather bag?” asked Case, “and if he did
will he accuse you of stealing the diamonds?”</p>

<p>“We’ll soon know all about it,” replied Clay,
unlocking the door.</p>
 </div>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chIV'>CHAPTER IV.—TWO GUESTS AND AN ARREST</h2>

<p class='first'>The other boys made no protest, although the
fear and dread of having gems which probably had
been stolen—which, at least, did not belong to
them—discovered in the cabin was in their hearts,
so Clay swung the door open.</p>

<p>A slender, black-eyed boy of about sixteen stood
there, an appealing look on his face. When he
dodged into the cabin they saw that his clothing
was shabby and insufficient for such a night, and
that it was soaked with rain. He shivered as he
stood by the table and motioned to Clay to lock
the door. Before he could thank them for the
hospitality so grudgingly extended, the policeman’s
strident voice came again from the deck.</p>

<p>“Here!” he said, angrily. Don’t try to make
a fool of me. You come on out here! You don’t
belong in there, you know. There’s been robbery
on the river to-day, and I want you.”</p>

<p>“If you’ll only tell him I belong here——”</p>

<p>The boy did not finish the sentence, for now the
ring of the officer’s club came on the door in good
earnest, rattling the glass panel and echoing
through the little space within like the crack of
doom, as Alex afterward expressed it.</p>

<p>“Open up! Open up, or I’ll break the door in!
I want the diamonds you stole, and I want you!”</p>

<p>The boys looked at each other with apprehension
showing in their manner, and the stranger seemed
to sense that something not on the surface was
going on in their minds.</p>

<p>“Well, officer, what do you want?”</p>

<p>Clay spoke the words with his head half out of
the doorway, his eyes momentarily blinded by the
gleam of an electric flashlight in the red, wet hands
of a heavy man in the uniform of the Chicago
police.</p>

<p>There was a short hesitation on the policeman’s
part.</p>

<p>“Where’s the lad who just ran in here?” he
then demanded, inserting his club into the crack of
the door and forcing it wide open, in spite of the
efforts of the boy to retain control of it. “You?”</p>

<p>“No,” answered Clay, “I’m not the lad who just
ran in here. What do you want?”</p>

<p>“You ought to know,” was the insolent rejoinder.
“There’s been a diamond robbery somewhere about
this pier, and I’m looking for the stones and the
thief. Let me in for a look around, or it will be the
station for yours.”</p>

<p>Clay stepped aside, unwillingly, and the officer
stooped down so as to clear the low doorway and
brushed into the cabin. His great bulk, his fat red
face, his arrogant manner, seemed to reduce the
size of the small room by at least half. His helmet
was running water, and he removed it and shook
the drops over the table.</p>

<p>In a moment he flashed his light around, resting
it longest, it seemed to the boys, on the coffee-pot
sitting on the electric stove. It seemed to the
imaginative Alex that he must see right through the
tin to the brown leather bag, and through the folds
of the brown leather bag to the stolen diamonds!</p>

<p>Next the policeman felt of Clay’s clothes and
sniffed suspiciously when he found them wet. He
seemed disappointed when the garments of Case
and Alex proved dry to his touch. His face
brightened again when he found evidences of
recent retreat from the storm in the clothes of the
stranger.</p>

<p>“So you are the one who just ducked in here?”
he said. “You’re the lad I saw skulking behind
the corner of the warehouse beyond not long ago.
What?”</p>

<p>The stranger looked the policeman straight in
the face with his black eyes, but made no reply. The
chums looked on, wondering how they were to get
rid of the incriminating coffee-pot.</p>

<p>They felt certain that the officer would make a
search of the place and discover the diamonds.</p>

<p>Then they would, in all probability, be hustled off to
the police station. They were still anxious about
the strange absence of Jule, but, after all, right glad
that the boy was not there to share this suspicion.</p>

<p>“Come,” grumbled the officer, shaking the
stranger roughly by the shoulder, “the game is up!
Give up the diamonds and come along.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t got the diamonds,” faltered the lad.
“I don’t know where they are. I’m not a thief. I
belong here with these boys.”</p>

<p>The officer turned to Clay, whom he now
recognized as one he had often seen about the boat,
and of whom he knew nothing discreditable.</p>

<p>“Does he belong here?” he asked.</p>

<p>Clay hesitated. The stranger looked so cold and
hungry, and his eyes were appealing, and his
manner asked for sympathy! He was sorely tempted to
make a statement in his behalf which was not true,
and which he knew would be regretted as long as he
lived.</p>

<p>To deny the story told by the shivering lad would
certainly cause his arrest as a diamond thief. The
policeman might go away with his prisoner without
searching the cabin if he was told that the lad
had never set foot there before. In that case the
gems would not be discovered in the possession of
the occupants of the place.</p>

<p>It was certainly in the interest of the boys that
the policeman should leave without searching the
cabin, and yet the stranger stood so in need of
protection that Clay could not for an instant decide
what to do. Then he caught the eyes of his chums,
fixed anxiously upon himself, and moved toward
the stove where the diamonds reposed in the
coffee-pot, surely an odd receptacle for so valuable a
parcel.</p>

<p>“I’m going to tell you the truth, officer,” he
said, “though it may get me into trouble. I——”</p>

<p>The stranger stepped forward, interrupting his
progress to the place where the stones were secreted.</p>

<p>“Wait,” the boy said, “I’m not going to get you
all into trouble. Officer,” he continued, turning to
the wondering policeman, “I told you a lie just now.
I don’t belong here with these boys. I’ve never
been in this cabin before—before to-night. I’ve
often watched the boat when it was lighted up on
cold nights, and when there was a smell of cooking
coming from the windows, as there was to-night, but
I don’t belong here. If you’ll take me away now,
I’ll be glad, because I don’t want to get these boys
into any scrape.”</p>

<p>“So you have loitered about here nights, have
you?” demanded Case, his sympathy for the lad
turning to suspicion. “What were you doing out
there by the warehouse a short time ago? Were
you in here after our chum went away. Are you the
thief who stole our money?”</p>

<p>Clay tried to check the boy, but his words poured
out in a torrent of suspicion and reproach until the
officer interrupted him.</p>

<p>“So ho!” he cried, “there’s been another robbery
in your vicinity to-night, has there? You’ve kept
yourself busy, eh? How much did you lose, lad?”
he continued, turning to Clay.</p>

<p>“Case shouldn’t have mentioned it, because we
really don’t know, yet, whether it has been stolen or
not,” Clay explained, “but the sum we miss now is
two hundred dollars.”</p>

<p>The policeman whistled softly.</p>

<p>“Do you happen to have it with you, lad?” he
asked, facing the stranger with accusing eyes.</p>

<p>“I never took it!” insisted the boy.</p>

<p>“Search him!” cried Case, who seemed
determined to say and do exactly the wrong thing that
night.</p>

<p>“He doesn’t look like a thief,” Clay suggested,
glad to be able to say something in the dejected lad’s
favor.</p>

<p>“Much you know what a thief looks like!” said
the officer.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe he is a thief,” declared Alex. “I
don’t believe he ever stole the diamonds!”</p>

<p>“We’ll pass it on to the judge,” grinned the
policeman. “Many’s the innocent face with a
black heart behind it. So I’ll be taking the boy to
the sergeant, and asking you boys to come to the
trial.”</p>

<p>A fierce dash of rain came against the cabin
windows and a burst of thunder for an instant drowned
all other sounds. When the quick shock of it was
over the policeman was outside, pushing against the
wind and rain with his prisoner.</p>

<p>“What kind of a dream is this?” asked Alex,
whimsically.</p>

<p>“A dream of a thief!” responded Case.</p>

<p>“Oh, quit it!” interposed Alex. “I think
sometimes you haven’t got common sense.
I don’t believe that boy ever stole our money.”</p>

<p>“What was he hanging about for, then? I
shouldn’t wonder if he did worse—if he attacked
Jule and left him lying dead somewhere.”</p>

<p>“You always go to extreme, Case,” smiled Clay.
“What I’m thinking about now is that the policeman
went away without searching the cabin and finding
the diamonds! He says they were stolen to-day.
Well, if he had found them here what would he have
done?”</p>

<p>“Pinched us!” exclaimed Alex.</p>

<p>“You’ll wash the dishes in the morning for that,
Alex,” grinned Case. “That’s slang.”</p>

<p>“Not!” retorted the other. “That is what the
policemen call it themselves. They say ‘pinched,’
and that brings the word into legitimate use. Guess
I know slang when I hear it.”</p>

<p>“Is that the boy you saw fighting at the head of
the pier?” asked Case, in a moment, of Clay.</p>

<p>“Not a bit like him,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Well, what was he watching the boat for?”</p>

<p>“He explained that. He was lonesome.”</p>

<p>“Then why couldn’t he have gone home?”
grumbled Case. “I just think he knows something
about where Jule is, or why he went away. I wish
we had asked him.”</p>

<p>“I’m getting anxious about Jule,” Clay said.
“There may be some connection between his
absence and the robbery.”</p>

<p>“I’ll just bet he took the money with him when he
went away!” exclaimed Alex. “If he had to go
away somewhere, and there was no one to leave in
the boat, that’s just what he would have done.”</p>

<p>“When he comes,” Clay advised, echoing Alex’s
request, “don’t say a word to him about the money.
If he has it, or if he put it away in another place, he
will say so soon enough. There’s someone else on
the deck!” he added, as a quick step was heard.</p>

<p>“This seems to be a sort of reception night,”
Alex laughed. “Wonder who the new person can
be? Why, it’s Jule!”</p>

<p>This last sentence as the door opened and a boy
much smaller than the others bounded inside. He
was covered from the crown of his red head to the
soles of his feet with oilskins, which, dripping, made
small lakes and rivers on the cabin floor.</p>

<p>Alex darted forward and began pummeling the
boy on the shoulders with his fists.</p>

<p>“Where have you been?” he cried. “You’ve
given us a bad evening, old man. Come. Tell us
about it.”</p>

<p>Jule took off the oilskin coat, leggings, and hat
quite deliberately and turned his attention to the
electric stove where the coffee-pot was still sitting.</p>

<p>The boys stood watching him with eager eyes.
Would he say anything about the money? Had he
taken it with him? Had he placed it in a more
secure hiding-place? The questions were in their
faces, although not spoken, and Jule saw that
something unusual was going on.</p>

<p>“Where did you get the oilskins?” asked Alex,
glad of any excuse to break the pregnant silence.</p>

<p>Jule lifted his red eyebrows with a comical
grimace and walked toward the coffee-pot. He was
small and thin, and his freckled face was pathetically
wasted as to flesh, but his blue eyes were bright
and merry. As he moved toward the electric
stove—the one place the boys wished him to keep away
from just then—a racking cough convulsed the
emaciated frame for a moment.</p>

<p>“Wait!” Alex exclaimed, as Jule recovered
from the spasm of coughing and reached for the
coffee-pot. “Wait! I’ll get you the coffee!”</p>

<p>“I’ve already connected with it,” answered the
boy, taking the pot by the handle and shaking it.</p>

<p>The three stood by, waiting. After all, they
thought, it did not matter so much if he did know
about the diamonds. He would have to know
sometime. The only reason why they objected to the
gems coming into the case immediately was that the
boy would become excited and forget to tell
whatever he knew about the money.</p>

<p>“I’m going to ask him, plump out!” whispered
Case to Clay, as Jule lifted the pot and balanced it
in his hand, as if to see what the chances were for a
full cup.</p>

<p>Clay restrained the impulsive boy by a motion of
his hand. Jule did not seem pleased with the
investigation of the coffee-pot. There was a bumping
sound inside instead of the swish of the stimulating
liquid he sought. He lifted the lid and looked in.</p>

<p>They saw him take out the brown leather bag and
hold it up between his eyes and the light. Then
he shook it, bringing forth from the bag the musical
tinkle of the gems. After a second’s hesitation, he
started to open the bag, but Alex snatched it away
from him.</p>

<p>“Not until you tell us where you have been,”
grinned Alex, dangling the bag before Jule’s eyes.
“Not until you tell us where you got those oilskins.
Not until you tell us everything about what you’ve
been doing to-night! Then we’ll let you know
what’s in this bag!”</p>
 </div>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chV'>CHAPTER V.—THE BOY FROM PERU</h2>

<p class='first'>What Alex really wanted to say was: “Not
until you tell us whether our money is safe.” But he
restrained his tongue and rattled the contents of the
bag alluringly.</p>

<p>“That’s a funny thing to keep in a coffee-pot,”
Jule exclaimed. “What did you make the coffee
in to-night? What is in the bag?”</p>

<p>“Tell us!” insisted Clay.</p>

<p>“Well, after I saw you coming, down by the
warehouse, you know,” began the boy, nodding at
Clay and dropping into a chair, “I went on down to
Madison street and got to Doctor Holcomb’s office
without getting wet at all. The oilskins he sent
me did the business—kept me dry as tinder in all
that rain.”</p>

<p>“So he sent for you, did he, and supplied the
oilskins?”</p>

<p>It was Clay who asked the question. There was
hope in the lad’s breast now, for Jule would not
be apt to go so far away without taking some
precautions regarding the money.</p>

<p>“Oh, I told you all about that,” Jule went on,
impatiently, as if reciting something already well
known. “I remained here until I saw you coming,
over there by the warehouse,” the boy continued,
turning to Clay, “then I went out to meet you, so as
to tell about my going away to see Dr. Holcomb.
When I got to the end of the wharf you were not
there, but in a moment I saw you at the corner of the
building, and called out to you to watch the boat
while I went to see the doctor.”</p>

<p>“Did you wait until I got into the cabin?” asked
Clay, turning away so that the astonishment in his
face might not be seen.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I made sure you were in the cabin
before I went away,” was the disheartening reply. “I
wasn’t going to leave the boat, not with all our
money in it, alone for a minute,” he went on.</p>

<p>Case opened his lips to speak, but Clay gave his
arm such a pinch of warning that he immediately
closed them again without speaking a word of the
hot sentence that was in his mind. The blow had
fallen. There was nothing more to say!</p>

<p>Jule had mistaken some thief for Clay, had left
the boat in his care, and the money had been stolen!
There was nothing more to do except never to let
the boy know what the mistake had cost—and to go
about earning more!</p>

<p>The three boys took the matter calmly. Up to
this minute they had all hoped and half believed that
Jule had either taken the money away with him or
hidden it in another spot. Now the last hope was
gone. They gathered about the table, glad of
something to engage their thoughts, exhibited the
diamonds, and told how they came to be in their
possession. Jule was enthusiastic over the find, as he
called it.</p>

<p>“And now,” Clay said, after the story had been
told and the boys had expressed various opinions as
to the ownership of the stones, “we may as well
hide the diamonds away and make more coffee.
Where shall I put them?”</p>

<p>“Why, with the money, of course!” exclaimed
Jule.</p>

<p>“Not if you——”</p>

<p>Alex stepped on Case’s toe and the remark was
never completed.</p>

<p>“All right,” Clay grinned, “I’ll put them in the
square box with the red cover, and put that into the
round box. That is where the money was put, eh,
Jule? You handled it last.”</p>

<p>“That’s where you’ll find it!” the boy answered,
and again the three turned away their faces.</p>

<p>Clay put the diamonds in the box and laid it away.
Then more coffee was made, and rolls and sausages
brought out, and all four fell to with keen appetites,
Alex explaining that the previous meal that night
had not been satisfying because of the absence of
Jule, and because of the excitement of the
policeman’s visit and the arrest of the stranger.</p>

<p>There was no doubt in the minds of the three now
that the boy who had been arrested had been the
one Jule had seen by the warehouse, the one who
had been seen to enter the cabin, the one who had
taken the money!</p>

<p>The one thing in opposition to this theory was the
fact that the boy had returned to the vicinity of the
boat after taking the money—if, indeed, he had not
remained about the warehouse during all the time
which had intervened between the taking of the
money and the arrival of the officer. Then, too, he
had voluntarily entered the cabin, to escape from the
officer. That did not look like the act of a guilty
person.</p>

<p>“Who do you think this strange boy is?” asked
Jule, at the conclusion of the story. “I like the way
he spoke up to the policeman and said he had lied
about belonging here. It is a sure thing he’s
honest, and never stole the diamonds. What do you
think?” he demanded, turning to his chums.</p>

<p>“He may be honest,” Clay answered.</p>

<p>“He’s a thief!” Case thundered.</p>

<p>“He’s all right!” insisted Alex.</p>

<p>“Anyway,” Jule continued, with a grin at the
diverse opinions of the stranger so expressed, “it is
certain he saw Clay pick up the brown leather bag,
and the chances are that he knew where the stones
were when the policeman took him away. You say
someone looked in at the window. Well, that was
this lad, and he saw the diamonds on the table, and
saw you put them in the coffee-pot. If he’s honest
he’ll wait until he finds the owner of the diamonds,
and then tell him where they are. If he is a crook
he’ll tell the police about seeing them here and get us
all into trouble.”</p>

<p>“They were here when he was arrested,” Alex
urged, “and he never said a word about them. If he
knew about them, he would have told the officer,
wouldn’t he? I don’t believe he knows anything
about the diamonds or the mo——”</p>

<p>Clay gave the boy’s leg a pinch under the table.</p>

<p>“Or the manner in which they came here,” Alex
concluded, trying to change “money” into
“manner” and not succeeding very well.</p>

<p>While the boys talked, they were preparing their
beds for the night There were two of these, And
they were almost like hammocks let down from the
low ceiling, being attached to strong rods by chains.
When drawn up the bottoms of the beds looked
exactly like the ceiling; when let down strong springs
and soft mattresses were disclosed.</p>

<p>Case had already climbed into the one he occupied
with Clay when a timid knock came on the door.</p>

<p>“Reception night!” gasped Alex.</p>

<p>“Perhaps it is the policeman come back after the
diamonds,” suggested Case. “That little thief has
told about seeing them here, and we’re all to be
arrested!”</p>

<p>“Imagine one notch farther, and get us hanged
for murdering the owner of the diamonds!” scorned
Alex. “You certainly do let out the rankest
prophecies! Shall I open the door, fellows?”</p>

<p>There was another knock, and the boy did not
wait for an answer, but turned the key and threw
the door half open. Then he dodged back, and the
slender, black-eyed lad who had been taken away by
the policeman entered the cabin. It was still raining,
and his garments contributed tiny lakes and rivers to
the damp spots already on the floor. He stood silent
a moment, fumbling with his cap, wringing wet, and
then found his voice.</p>

<p>“I thought,” he began.</p>

<p>He stopped and looked toward the coffee-pot, still
steaming. Alex lifted it and poured out a cup of
strong coffee, which, together with a plate of cold
beans and a loaf of bread, he set before the wet boy.</p>

<p>“I guess you’re hungry,” he said, unconcernedly.</p>

<p>The stranger fell to, but there was a look of
amazement in his face which no one there failed to
observe. Case thought the look meant that he was
astonished to find that the diamonds were not in the
pot. Clay believed that the lad was upset by the
courteous treatment he was receiving. Alex
understood that it was because of Jule’s presence that the
boy was so all at sea, mentally.</p>

<p>All the lads saw in the return of the boy some
faint chance to solve the mystery of the loss of the
money. “Perhaps,” hopeful Alex thought, “he has
repented and brought the money back with him.”
Clay watched the boy for a moment and said, tentatively:</p>

<p>“They didn’t keep you at the station very long?”
“No,” was the confused reply. “I proved my
innocence and they let me go. I came back here to
let you know.”</p>

<p>“Why have you been hanging around the boat?”
asked Case, leaning over the side of his bed. “You
were out there by the warehouse a long time
to-night, and someone from the boat called out to you.”</p>

<p>Jule looked up suspiciously, but Case went on:</p>

<p>“Then you came into the cabin.”</p>

<p>The stranger shook his head.</p>

<p>“You are mistaken,” he insisted.</p>

<p>“Let him alone!” Alex ordered. “Give him a
chance to eat his supper, can’t you. What’s your
name, kid?” he continued, forgetful of his own
suggestion that the stranger be permitted to eat in
peace.</p>

<p>“Frank Porter,” was the quick reply. “I was
born near the headwaters of the Amazon, in Peru.
I came to Chicago to attend to some business, and
haven’t been able to get back.”</p>

<p>The four opened their eyes in wonder. Here
was a boy who had lived in the country they
had planned to visit, and who knew all about the
river they were so anxious to explore.</p>

<p>“Go on!” Clay said, eagerly.</p>

<p>“I heard that you boys were going to the
foothills of the Andes,” Frank went on, “and I thought
you might let me go with you, only I could
never find the courage to come and ask you
about it?”</p>

<p>“And that is what you’ve been hanging around
here for?” asked Case.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well,” Case continued, brutally, “it costs
money to run this boat. Can you pay your share of
the expense?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t any money.” was the dejected reply.</p>

<p>“You speak English pretty handily for a native
of Peru!” Case taunted, while Alex frowned at the
impudence of the suggestion.</p>

<p>“My father was a Chicago man, and my mother
was a native of New Orleans,” was the
straight-forward answer. “I know English and Spanish and
a lot of Amazon valley dialects. I may be able to
make myself useful on the journey. You’ll need a
guide,” he added, hopefully.</p>

<p>Neither of the three dared hint, in the presence of
Jule, how far away that journey now was! And
Jule did not know!</p>

<p>“All right,” Alex agreed, putting off the evil
time when Jule would have to know, “you can go,
and we’ll let you stay here with us until we start.
We’ll need you. Isn’t that right, boys?”</p>

<p>They all declared that it was entirely right, but
Case’s acquiescence seemed a little forced, though
the boy’s stay with them seemed to be only for that
night. Nothing whatever was said about the
diamonds, and Case took the precaution of putting them
inside his pillow-slip before he went to sleep. It
was daylight before the boys awoke, for the
evening had been an exciting one, and they had had much
to think over before they could sleep.</p>

<p>Clay rolled out of bed and turned the electric
switch, for it was still dark in the cabin. The first
thing that met his eyes was the rude bed on the
floor which had been made up for Frank Porter. It
was empty, and the cabin door was ajar. The boy
had gone without a word of good-bye! Then Clay
saw something else. It was a copy of an evening
newspaper, open at the “lost and found” page. He
read the paragraph to which a pencil-made hand
pointed, and set up a great shout.</p>

<p>“Boys!” he cried. “Wake up and hear the
blessed news! There’s a reward of $500 offered for
the return of the diamonds, and no questions asked.
We’ll go in style, go to-day! What?”</p>
 </div>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chVI'>CHAPTER VI.—$500 REWARD——LIGHTS OF PARA</h2>

<p class='first'>“Why, of course we’re going to-day!” came
from Jule’s bed. “Why not? Haven’t we been
planning on to-day right along?”</p>

<p>The boy bounced out of his bed. His three chums
regarded each other with glances of understanding.
They had almost forgotten, in the excitement of the
moment, that, though all hope of getting away in
the immediate future had been abandoned by them,
Jule did not know.</p>

<p>“Of course, this very day!” shouted Case. “We
will be ready in no time, just as soon as we get
breakfast. Here, Alex,” he cried, “you make
coffee, and I’ll run over and see Captain Joe. We’ll
have to tell him about it.”</p>

<p>“If Frank Porter is going with us,” Clay
declared, “he’ll have to be showing up.”</p>

<p>Alex busied himself making coffee and frying
bacon and eggs and Clay stepped outside with Case.</p>

<p>“Now, don’t get a grouch on,” he advised, “and
tell Jule that he came near defeating all our plans.</p>

<p>He mistook someone for me, but that wasn’t
anything unusual. I’ve made mistakes about people
before now myself. Just let it all go, and the kid won’t
have the thing to worry over.”</p>

<p>“I wonder where he went last night?” Case said,
doggedly.</p>

<p>“Why, he told us that he went to see Dr.
Holcomb,” Clay explained. “He’ll tell us what he
went to see him about when he gets ready. Now,
don’t forget and let the cat out of the bag.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you ever think I will,” promised Case.
“I’ll go now and see Captain Joe, and tell him to be
quick with the gasoline, and he’ll have it on board
before noon. Good old boy, Captain Joe.”</p>

<p>“There never was any better!” echoed Clay.
While they talked a stoutish, gray-haired man
with a very red face and a wooden leg not at all
concealed by his trousers came stumping down the pier,
waving a pudgy hand in greeting.</p>

<p>“Morning, boys!” he cried.</p>

<p>“Morning, Captain Joe!” answered the boys, in
a breath. “We were just going up to see you about
the gasoline. We’re off to-day, you know,” they
both shouted, talking so fast that neither sensed that
the other was speaking.</p>

<p>Captain Joe came to where the boys stood and
looked the motor boat over critically. He had been
a sea captain for years, and was never so happy as
when passing judgment on a vessel. Two years
before he had met with an accident which had
deprived him of one leg, and since that time he had
gained a living by conducting a little ship and motor
boat supply store not far from the slip where the
<i>Rambler</i> lay. His practical suggestions had been
invaluable to the boys in fitting out the <i>Rambler</i>.</p>

<p>“She looks fit as a fiddle,” the old man declared,
cocking his head to one side and running his eyes
over the graceful lines of the craft. “When you
get out into the ocean just keep her head on, and
she’ll sail like a duck. My! It would be a treat to
go along with you!”</p>

<p>“We’ll make an extra bunk for you, Captain Joe,”
Clay cut in, eagerly. “You know you’d be welcome.”</p>

<p>“I’m too old, lads,” returned the captain, “and
besides. I’ve got my own little bread-and-butter shop
to look after. But here,” he continued, taking a
packet sealed in oilskin from his breast, “here’s a
little present for you. I’m giving it to you with
the understanding, though, mind, that you never
open it until you find yourself in a tight place!
There is a word of advice in it,” he went on, “and it
may cheer you up a bit when you open it.”</p>

<p>Clay’s face was very grave as he took the packet.
“We’ll do just as you say, Captain Joe,” he
promised, “and we’ll think of you as often as you think
of us! But we hope never to get into a tight place.
You’ll come and see us off?”</p>

<p>“Certainly—certainly!” declared the captain.
“I couldn’t let my boys sail away without being
there to wish ’em good luck. I’ll have the gasoline
down here in an hour, and then off you go, and may
every hope you have be thrifty and bud into two
more—all coming into harbor with sails set!”</p>

<p>The old man stumped away, and the boys
returned to the cabin. While breakfast was being
eaten a knock was heard and Frank Porter’s face
showed through the glass panel. Alex opened the
door and grabbed him by the shoulders.</p>

<p>“Come on in,” he shouted. “You’re just in time
for some of my world-without-end pancakes. No
one else ever made such pancakes as these. You’re
just in time, for we’re going to sail before noon.”</p>

<p>The boys were so happy in their good fortune
that all suspicions of the integrity of the lad were
for the time forgotten, and he was given a very
friendly welcome indeed. He explained that he had
been out in the city for a walk, and had been
delayed by an accident which had blocked a street and
sent him a long way around.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Clay, after breakfast, “I’ll go up
to this advertiser’s address and get the reward for
the restoration of the diamonds, and then we’ll be
all ready for blue water.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go with you,” volunteered Alex.</p>

<p>“Not much you won’t,” Case put in. “You’ll
stay here on the boat and wash dishes as a penalty
for talking slang.”</p>

<p>While the boys argued Clay and Jule started
away. It was a bright Spring morning, and the air
was clear and invigorating, for Chicago. Jule threw
out his chest as they walked along, taking in long
breaths.</p>

<p>“I begin to feel well already!” he said. “Oh,
I’ll be well before we get to the Gulf of Mexico!”</p>

<p>“What did Dr. Holcomb tell you last night?”
asked Clay, curious to know the reason for the visit
of the night before to the office of the physician.
Jule hesitated an instant, and then turned a pair of
merry blue eyes on his companion.</p>

<p>“Don’t you wish you knew?” he asked, provokingly.</p>

<p>“Oh, if it is anything private——” Clay began.</p>

<p>“It is a secret!” acknowledged the boy. “I’m
not to tell anyone about it until we get back. I
think it jolly to have a secret.”</p>

<p>“I know,” Clay guessed, “he said you were
going to get well down on the Amazon. Huh, we
knew that before!”</p>

<p>“Guess again,” laughed Jule, as they turned the
corner of Madison and Dearborn streets. “I’ll tell
you—when we get back! But there is the Boyce
building, and here is the name of the lawyer who
advertised to give the reward for the return of the
diamonds—and no questions asked!”</p>

<p>Lawyer Sharp had just reached his office as the
boys entered. He met them with a smile and
seemed to consider the return of the stones as a
matter of course. He opened his safe and took
therefrom a package of banknotes which seemed to
have been placed there for that special occasion.</p>

<p>“I’m not to ask any questions, you know,” he
said, as Clay tendered the brown leather bag and
received the money, “but I would like to know
who sent you here with the diamonds. They are
worth fifty thousand dollars, I presume you
know?”</p>

<p>“No,” answered Clay, “we didn’t know that.”</p>

<p>“I never knew there was that much money in
Chicago!” put in Jule.</p>

<p>“But you didn’t answer my question.”</p>

<p>“I found the diamonds on the ground,” Clay
replied, not referring to the way they came there,
“and saw the advertisement in an evening
newspaper. That’s all.”</p>

<p>“Where did you get the newspaper?”</p>

<p>There was a twinkle in the lawyer’s eyes, as if he,
too, had a secret that was hard to keep.</p>

<p>“Why,” Clay answered, “why——”</p>

<p>He turned to Jule with a puzzled look on his face.</p>

<p>“Where do you think that newspaper came
from?” he asked, puzzled, too.</p>

<p>Jule shook his head, looking from the lawyer to
the brown leather bag, now empty, the gems being
in the lawyer’s hand.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” he said. “You found it on the
boat, I take it.”</p>

<p>“Someone must have placed it there,” said the
lawyer.</p>

<p>“It was marked,” Clay explained, “with a finger
pointing to the advertisement. Now, what do you
think of that? Why——”</p>

<p>“Then someone put it there,” Jule declared.
“Someone who wanted us to get the reward! I’ll
bet it was Captain Joe.”</p>

<p>“Or Dr. Holcomb,” Clay continued.</p>

<p>“Very strange proceeding!” insisted the lawyer.
“If anyone knew where the diamonds were, and
saw fit to throw away $500, he might have done
that, but did this Captain Joe you speak of, or this
Dr. Holcomb, know that you had the stones?”</p>

<p>“Of course not!” answered Jule. “No one knew.”</p>

<p>“When were the diamonds stolen?” asked Clay.</p>

<p>“Early yesterday morning, though the loss was
not reported then.”</p>

<p>“Who stole them?” was the next question.</p>

<p>The lawyer laughed outright at this.</p>

<p>“If we knew,” he said, “we’d have him in jail
But we don’t know. We thought that, perhaps, the
one who came for the reward might know.”</p>

<p>“If you think that,” Clay exclaimed, flushing
with anger, “if you think I stole them, I will return
the reward!”</p>

<p>“We don’t think so,” explained the lawyer. “If
we did we’d have had a policeman here. Well,
there’s your money. I’m busy!”</p>

<p>The boys went out into the hall and took the
elevator without another word being said. The
lawyer’s mood had been more preoccupied and not
so friendly at the last.</p>

<p>“There is something queer about it!” Jule
said, as they took a Madison street-car. “Lookout
there!”</p>

<p>A young man who was running for the car
slipped and came near falling under the wheels as
the boy started up in his seat and involuntarily called
out.</p>

<p>“That was a close call!” Clay exclaimed.</p>

<p>“But he got on,” Jule said. “There he is, on
the back of the car.”</p>

<p>“Why,” Clay whispered, “I saw that man in the
lower hall when we went up to the lawyer’s office,
and again when we came down. See that scar on
his cheek? Looks as if he had been wounded
there. Well, I noticed that both times.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he was thinking of getting the
diamonds or the money away from us,” suggested Jule.
“He’d have a good time doing it!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess not,” Clay replied, but he was
not quite easy in his mind until the young man—a
dark young man in a greenish suit, with little black
eyes and a tiny mustache, turned up at the ends, left
the car at the bridge.</p>

<p>The gasoline was on board long before noon,
Captain Joe having seen to that personally, and then
all was bustle as the boys headed down the drainage
canal for the Mississippi. The last familiar figure
they saw as they got under way, the motors ticking
merrily under the hatch on the deck floor, was that
of Captain Joe, standing on the pier and waving a
white handkerchief from a pudgy hand.</p>

<p>The boys were delighted with the trip down to the
Gulf of Mexico, and agreed that if they could ever
afford it they would some day take a leisurely
journey down the Mississippi in the motor boat.</p>

<p>The <i>Rambler</i> passed through the Caribbean sea
without mishap, though the boys were more than
once reminded of the advice of Captain Joe, to
“keep her head on.” It was rather more difficult
navigating the eastern coast, but there were no
serious accidents, and Jule gained in health every
minute. On the way down Frank, now a welcome
member of the party, gave the boys lessons in
Spanish, and many a friendly tilt they had over their
pronunciation of the tongue spoken principally in
South America.</p>

<p>One evening in early June the lights of Para
gladdened the eyes of the boys, for there, away to the
north, ran the current of the mighty Amazon!</p>
 </div>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chVII'>CHAPTER VII.—A BOAT FROM THE SOUTH BRANCH</h2>

<p class='first'>The boys had headed the <i>Rambler</i> for Para,
which is some distance south of the mouth of the
Amazon, for two reasons. The first was that
supplies could be purchased there cheaper than at the
towns in the interior of Brazil, as the city is the
principal commercial port of that country. They
had put in a good supply of gasoline at New
Orleans, but there was not near enough in the tanks
to attempt the navigation of the long stretch of water
ahead of them. Besides, their supply of provisions
was running short.</p>

<p>There are several cities of good size along the
Amazon and her tributaries, but excessive freight
rates would make purchases there too expensive
for the lessening supply of ready money. Trading
vessels from all parts of the world make a highway
of the Amazon, cargoes being put off and taken on
more than two thousand miles from the Atlantic
coast. In fact, navigation of the river and its
branches ends only at the gorges of the eastern
Andes.</p>

<p>Para is a modern city in many ways, and boasts
a population of something over a quarter of a
million. It is sixty-five miles from the coast, on a
river of the same name, three thousand from New
York, and three thousand from Buenos Aires. The
river there is something like twenty feet in depth,
but so sloping are the shores that most of the
loading and unloading is done with the aid of lighters.</p>

<p>The second reason for the decision to enter the
Amazon by way of Para was that the great
waterway of South America is treacherous. In the
language of the native Brazilian Indians, Amazon
means “boat destroyer.” There are monster tidal
waves at the mouth, and the wash from above so
reduces the depth that vessels are frequently
stranded on bars of sand. In addition to these
difficulties, there are numerous islands in the river,
which is fully fifty miles in width at a distance of
a hundred miles from the coast, and it requires the
service of an experienced pilot to keep the direct
course.</p>

<p>The route to the foothills of the Andes is
considerably longer by way of Para, but the boys were
in no hurry to bring their pleasant excursion to a
close, and the above reasons were considered
sufficient for the choice they made. Besides, there
would be an opportunity to view the lower Amazon
on the way down.</p>

<p>When the lights of Para came into view that
night, the boys decided to anchor a short distance
above the city and remain there through the
following day, purchasing the needed supplies. Then, on
the second morning, they could proceed westward,
passing through the estuaries and streams which
connect the Para river with the Amazon, and so on
to the mountains. The point of junction with the
Amazon is to the west of Marajo island, a body of
land larger than some of the New England states.</p>

<p>The <i>Rambler</i>, therefore, came to anchor in a slip
well to the west of the city, and, after partaking of
supper, the boys set out to see the sights of the first
foreign town they had ever set eyes on—that is, the
first foreign town of importance which they had seen
at close range. Case was left on board, and when
the shore party returned he sat on the prow of the
boat, watchful and alert.</p>

<p>“What did you see in the city?” he asked, as the
boys began letting down the bunks.</p>

<p>“Same old story,” yawned Jule. “Nothing but
houses! I can find just as queer places in Chicago
as I saw there.”</p>

<p>“Good old Chicago!” exclaimed Alex, a flood of
memories brought up by the mention of the name.</p>

<p>“Homesick?” asked Case, with a provoking
smile.</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it! I guess I can like a city, and
think of her, and the good times I’ve had there
without wanting to go straight back to her! This
is good enough for me right now.”</p>

<p>“Did you try your Spanish on anyone?” laughed
Case, presently. “If you did, you probably had to
take to our heels in order to keep out of jail,” he
continued.</p>

<p>Case and Alex had indulged in many a good-natured
squabble over the pronunciation of certain
Spanish words, and each had predicted all kinds of
trouble for the other when the time to use the
language came.</p>

<p>“Sure I talked Spanish,” replied Alex, a whimsical
smile spreading over his face. “I delivered an
oration in the city hall! Didn’t I, Frank?”</p>

<p>Frank Porter and Alex had become fast friends.
They bunked together and planned mischief together.
In fact, Clay and Case were having rather
a busy time with Alex, Jule, and Frank. Jule’s
health was improving so fast, and he was so full of
animal spirits because of his new lease of life, that
he kept things moving pretty lively, while Frank
and Alex were always engaged in some mischief,
not necessarily vicious mischief, but just fantastic
enough to keep the company stirred up most of the
time.</p>

<p>Frank promptly backed Alex up in the ridiculous
assertion that he had made, and was as promptly
chased off the deck by Case, who growled at the
pranks of the boys one minute and joined in with
them the next. It was close on to midnight when
Case moved over to where Clay sat and began a
whispered conversation with him.</p>

<p>“Did you see anyone you knew in Para, that is,
anyone besides your own party?” he asked.</p>

<p>“That is a strange question,” Clay responded.
“Of course I did not. Why do you ask?”</p>

<p>“One more question,” Case went on. “Have
you seen anything since you came here with a
familiar look to it?”</p>

<p>“Of course not. We are a long way from
anything I know the look of, except what came with us.”</p>

<p>“Look around you now,” advised Case, “and see
if there isn’t something familiar in view.”</p>

<p>“In the boat, you mean?”</p>

<p>“No, in the river.”</p>

<p>“There’s the water!” laughed Clay. “That
looks familiar.”</p>

<p>“And the ships?”</p>

<p>There was a moon nearly at the full, and a soft
light lay over the river and the sleeping city beyond.
Clay arose and looked over the scene and then
thoughtfully seated himself again. Case regarded
him expectantly, but waited for him to speak.</p>

<p>“I know what you mean,” Clay said. “What
about it?”</p>

<p>“That’s what I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“When did you first see it?”</p>

<p>“Of course you mean that smoky little steamer
with yellow and green on her stack? That is what
I am referring to.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Clay answered. “That is the only
familiar thing in sight, so far as I can see.”</p>

<p>“You remember where you saw her last?”</p>

<p>“Yes; in the South Branch. She lay near us
the day before we left on this trip.”</p>

<p>“Well,” Case went on, “you asked me when I
first saw her—here, I presume you mean—and I’ll
tell you that she came puffing in just after you boys
left for the shore. You were still in sight, on a pier,
when she anchored, and they got out a boat and
rowed over after you.”</p>

<p>“Whew!” whistled Clay, in astonishment.</p>

<p>“That’s why I asked you if you saw anybody in
Para that you had ever seen before.”</p>

<p>“Did you recognize any of the people who went
ashore in the boat as persons you had seen before—in
Chicago or elsewhere?”</p>

<p>“Yes; there was a man, a youngish man with a
scar on his cheek, his left cheek, almost under the
ear, with little black, piggy eyes, and a tiny black
mustache, with the ends turned up. He seemed to
be giving orders to the others. Ever see him
before?”</p>

<p>Clay remembered that morning in Chicago, when
he had secured the reward for restoring the
diamonds. This was the man who had run after the
car which Jule and himself had taken at the corner
of Madison and Dearborn streets. He stated the
incident, briefly, to his companion.</p>

<p>“Why, I saw that same man on the steamer in
the South Branch,” Case exclaimed. “That is why
I noted his appearance so carefully here. He wore
a greenish suit in Chicago.”</p>

<p>“He had such a suit on when I saw him that
morning,” Clay said.</p>

<p>“Well,” Case mused, directly, “he’s come after us?”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by that?”</p>

<p>“We might have delivered the stones to the wrong party.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” cried Clay. “The advertisement
would have brought the owner and an officer to the
place where they were to be returned and the
reward given out. A crook wouldn’t advertise in that
open way. This fellow is not on any legitimate
business, if his errand here is concerned with us.”</p>

<p>“But why should he follow us?” persisted Case.
“That is just what I don’t know,” puzzled Clay.
“We have nothing he could rob us of, except the
boat, and that doesn’t belong to us. We haven’t
done anything anybody could take offense at, or
consider hostile.”</p>

<p>“Well, he’s here,” Case concluded, “and it is
up to us to keep a sharp eye on him. There! He’s
returning to the steamer now.”</p>

<p>As the boy spoke a boat put out from a pier on
the south shore and proceeded swiftly toward the
steamer with the yellow and green stack. It was
not light enough out on the river to enable the boys
to recognize any of the faces in the craft, but Case
put his hand on Clay’s arm, warning him to remain
silent until the rowers came under the prow light
of the steamer.</p>

<p>“That’s the man!” he said presently, as a light
from the deck of the steamer struck fairly in the
faces of those in the boat.</p>

<p>“Yes; that is the man!”</p>

<p>“I hope we aren’t going to have our whole trip
spoiled by anyone sneaking after us like this and
making trouble!” Case wailed.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to meet whatever comes,” Clay
reminded the other. “And now,” he continued,
“we’ll set a watch on deck for the night. In the
morning we’ll take on our supplies as early as
possible and get under way. We’ll soon find out
whether this fellow is following us, or whether his
appearance here is merely a coincidence.”</p>

<p>“I’ll watch to-night,” Case volunteered, but Clay
had other views. The conversation with Case had
brought back to his mind something Frank Porter
had said on the night of his first appearance at the
<i>Rambler</i>’s pier. There certainly was mystery
connected with the boy’s sudden appearance, with his
watching about in the storm for a view of the
<i>Rambler</i> and her crew, with his anxiety to get back
to the country he had left with the boys as companions.</p>

<p>So he explained to Case that he was not at all
sleepy, but might be on the next night, and so
persuaded the boy to go off to his bunk, with the
understanding that he (Case) should watch next if it was
thought best to station a guard. As soon as Case
was asleep, Clay went to the cabin and quietly awoke
Frank Porter.</p>

<p>“Come out on deck,” he instructed the boy, “I
want to talk with you.”</p>

<p>In five minutes the lad was out on the prow,
standing by Clay’s side, his face white, his figure
looking weak and irresolute.</p>

<p>“I know what you’re going to say,” the boy
began, without waiting for Clay to open the conversation.
“I have been wanting to see you alone ever
since that boat,” pointing to the steamer, “anchored
near the <i>Rambler</i>.”</p>

<p>“You recognize her?” asked Clay.</p>

<p>“The Senorita? Oh, yes, I saw her dropping
anchor here just as we reached the dock to-night, on
our way into the city.”</p>

<p>“And you saw the boat pulling for the shore?”
“Yes; don’t you remember I loitered behind the
others, and that Alex came back for me?”</p>

<p>“Yes; well, you saw a man in that boat you knew?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; a man I know and fear.”</p>

<p>“Have you anything more to say?” asked Clay,
wishing to give the boy the chance to tell whatever
story he might have to tell in his own way.</p>

<p>“Yes,” was the quick reply. “I’ll be short and
quick with it, too. I want you to put me ashore here
and go on without me.”</p>

<p>“Is that all you have to say?”</p>

<p>“Everything.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t the least idea that we’ll do a thing
like that, have you?” asked Clay, pitying the
dejected boy from the bottom of his heart.</p>

<p>“I thought you might be willing to do so.”</p>

<p>“But why?”</p>

<p>“Because you will all get into serious trouble if
you don’t. That man—I can’t tell you why—followed
me from Peru to Chicago. He persecuted me
in Chicago. You saw the plight I was in when I
came to you on that rainy night! I was hungry and
cold and afraid. You boys fed and warmed me and
took me into your lives. So I’m not going to let you
do anything more for me if it will make trouble for
you.”</p>

<p>“But if we leave you here,” Clay urged, “this
man of whom you are in fear will have you at his
mercy, won’t he?”</p>

<p>“I presume so, but he won’t set any traps for
you.”</p>

<p>“Can’t you tell me why he is following you?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“Then,” Clay declared, “you go back to your
bunk. You’re going to remain with us, and if
trouble comes we’ll fight it out together.”</p>

<p>“But you don’t know,” began the other, but Clay
hustled him away!</p>

<p>Then he sat for a long time in deep thought on
the dark deck.</p>
 </div>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chVIII'>CHAPTER VIII.—AN ADDITION TO THE PARTY</h2>

<p class='first'>The river is wide at Para, and there are always
dozens of steamers and trading vessels anchored off
the city. This night was no exception. There was
a little group of vessels lying within hailing distance
of the motor boat. The one nearest, perhaps, was
the steamer which Frank had called the <i>Señorita</i>, not
a large boat, but one having the appearance of great
speed.</p>

<p>There was little stir of life on the river, and Clay
watched light after light go out in the nearby craft
with a sensation of loneliness. Now and then, it
is true, he could hear a voice coming over the water,
but usually the words spoken were in an unfamiliar
tongue. The air was dry and warm.</p>

<p>The moon, passing farther to the west, had
encountered a bank of clouds, and was visible only
a part of the time. In these darker intervals,
whenever the listening boy heard the rattling of an oar
it seemed to him that the boat in which it swung was
stealthily approaching the <i>Rambler</i> with some
sinister purpose in the hearts of those within her.</p>

<p>He knew that Frank was not asleep, for he could
hear him tumbling about in his bunk, and more
than once he started up with the purpose of calling
to the lad and having the truth of the danger which
hung over him clearly defined, but each time he sat
down again, reluctant to press him on so delicate a
subject. His idea was that, at sometime during the
night, something would occur which might give him
an inkling of the threatened danger.</p>

<p>Just before daylight, what he half feared, half
hoped for, took place. During a dark moment he
heard the bunt, felt the jar, of a prow against the
side of the <i>Rambler</i>. He sat still and listened, his
only motion being that of an arm to bring his
automatic revolver into position for use.</p>

<p>Presently the light boat tipped a trifle to the east,
as if some heavy body or bodies were keeling her
over by clinging to the railing which ran around
the deck. Whispered words in Spanish followed,
and then the soft pad of a naked foot on the planks.</p>

<p>Clay’s purpose in remaining inactive at this time
and permitting the intruders to gain the deck was to
allow the invasion of the <i>Rambler</i> to proceed
without interruption until the object of the visit was
made known by some unmistakable proceeding.
For all he knew the object of the intrusion might be
larceny. In that case he did not wish to take a
human life, as he would be almost certain to do
should he open fire with his automatic revolver.</p>

<p>Presently the footsteps moved in the direction of
the cabin door, which was wide open. The bulk of
the cabin could only be outlined in the darkness,
and the creeping figure could not be seen at all.
The deck seemed empty save for himself, only the
soft pat-pat of naked feet showing the presence
of another.</p>

<p>The restless tumblings in the cabin had ceased,
and Clay was under the impression that Frank had
dropped off into slumber, but in this he was
mistaken. He was already rising to his feet to switch
on the light in the cabin when another light shot out
of the doorway like a bullet.</p>

<p>It proceeded from a powerful electric searchlight,
held in Frank’s left hand, and showed a weapon in
the right. Straight out of the doorway it flashed,
bringing into the center of a white circle the dusky
face and evil eyes of a native Indian, such as Clay
had observed on the streets of Para that evening.</p>

<p>The Indian was crouching low, his shoulders
hunched as if for a quick spring, and a knife flashed
back the light, a knife clutched in his right hand,
already half lifted. The object of the night visit
was no longer in doubt. Clay stepped forward, but
quick as he was the Indian was too active for him.</p>

<p>There was a sudden movement and a splash in the
river. When they cautiously peered over the
railing of the deck, a second later, nothing was to be
seen in the water below. Even the boat in which
the Indian had reached the <i>Rambler</i> had
disappeared. Frank threw the rays of his light far up
arid down the current, but no bobbing head came
within its circle.</p>

<p>“It is of no use to look for him,” the boy said.
“He can swim beneath the surface as handily as on
top.”</p>

<p>“But where is the boat?” asked Clay. “I
distinctly heard one strike the <i>Rambler</i>.”</p>

<p>“It was probably taken away at once,” answered
Frank. “The Indian was to do his work on board
and take to the river. Lucky thing you were on
guard.”</p>

<p>“It strikes me,” Clay returned, “that I had very
little to do with it. You heard him at first?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I hadn’t been to sleep. I anticipated
something of the sort. I warned you to-night in order
that you might be prepared for anything.</p>

<p>There was a short silence, during which both boys
turned their heads toward the <i>Señorita</i>, only a few
rods away.</p>

<p>“I have a notion that we’ll hear something doing
on board our honorable escort, in a minute,” said
Frank, lightly. “They’ll want to know why he
fell down on the pleasant task they set him.”</p>

<p>“You think he came from the steamer?”</p>

<p>“I have no doubt of it.”</p>

<p>They waited and listened a long time, but no
sounds of any kind came from the <i>Señorita</i>.</p>

<p>“They are too clever to permit him to return after
a failure,” Frank concluded. “Now you see what
you’re up against,” he added. “Are you ready to
set me ashore in the morning?”</p>

<p>“Hardly,” smiled Clay. “We started out
together, and we’ll stick together, if I have my way
about it. We’ll get our supplies in early and be out
of sight of Para long before night.”</p>

<p>“If I have my way about it,” Frank said, with
an air of determination, “you’ll leave me behind.
It would be a poor return for all your kindness if I
should get you all murdered.”</p>

<p>“Promise me that you will make no attempt to
leave us without my consent.”</p>

<p>“But——”</p>

<p>“Will you promise?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but you don’t know what is ahead of you if
I remain on the boat. We are going into a wild and
lawless country, and——”</p>

<p>“I understand. See! It is getting light in the
east. There will be no further trouble to-night, so
we may as well go to bed.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I won’t be able to sleep,” suggested
Frank.</p>

<p>“Then sit here and watch,” Clay advised, “and
remember, old man, I hold you to your promise!”</p>

<p>“You may trust me!”</p>

<p>The voice was low and steady, and Clay knew
that the boy meant just what he said, so he went
off to bed and slept until nine o’clock. When he
came out on deck, rubbing his eyes, all the boys
were there save Alex. Case and Frank, mindful of
Clay’s wish to get away as early as possible, had
attended to getting the supplies on board, and the
<i>Rambler</i> was ready to set her nose against the
streams leading to the Amazon. Clay learned all
this while preparing his breakfast.</p>

<p>“But where is Alex?” he asked.</p>

<p>“He is still on shore,” replied Case. “I told him
not to go away, but he rushed off when I was away.
Now we’ll have to go into the city and get him out
of some scrape.”</p>

<p>“You are mild in your prophecy of evil this
morning,” laughed Jule. “Ordinarily you would have
had him hung, drawn and quartered for trying to
rob a bank.”</p>

<p>Case hung his head and smiled at the reference
to his failing.</p>

<p>“Well, he ought to be here,” he said.</p>

<p>“I should think you would go out of business as
a prophet,” laughed Jule. “All your
prognostications fail. See! This one fails, for here comes
Alex now. What is that he is carrying?”</p>

<p>“Looks like a large Brazilian monkey,” replied
Frank.</p>

<p>“And the kid has an escort, at that!” roared
Jule. “Just see the mob chasing after him!”</p>

<p>“That is a dog he has,” Case exclaimed, looking
at the advancing boy through a glass. “If it isn’t a
half-grown, white bulldog. I’ll wash dishes for a
month. Must be heavy!”</p>

<p>“Well,” Clay grinned, “Alex is making a try for
the running record, if it is heavy. Look at him
cover the ground!”</p>

<p>“Better say, ‘How that boy did run, than here he
lies!’” hummed Jule.</p>

<p>“I guess he’s got good cause to run,” Clay
observed. “Looks to me as if that mob meant
business. You don’t suppose he stole the dog, do you.
Case? Why doesn’t he put him down?”</p>

<p>“Just like him to steal a dog and get the boat
held up here for a month,” Case answered. “Then
the rainy season will come on, and we’ll not enjoy
the trip at all.”</p>

<p>The boys all laughed heartily at this new
manifestation of Alex’s failing, and the boy turned away
from them and jumped into the little row-boat, now
ready for the rescue, attached to the prow.</p>

<p>“Here!” shouted Jule, “don’t go off that way!
I’m going with you. You can’t fight that mess
alone.”</p>

<p>But Case was pushing off, and the next instant
was rowing with long, steady strokes toward the
pier down which Alex must pass to reach the river
front.</p>

<p>The next minute Frank, who had planned to go
in the boat, was in the water, headed in the same
direction. The race on shore was now drawing to
a close.</p>

<p>Clay called out to Case not to leave the boat, but
to hold it ready for the pursued youngster to leap
into, but this was unnecessary, as Alex reached the
end of the pier before the boat could be forced there.
Frank was swimming like a duck in the water, but
was slowly being swept down stream.</p>

<p>Alex turned for an instant and faced a collection
of a score or more of disreputable-looking men and
boys who were dashing down the pier after him.
Then he lifted his face with a grin, gave out a long
“Whoop” of defiance and took to the river.</p>

<p>He still held the dog in his arms as he leaped, and,
Alex being obliged to loosen his hold in order to
swim, that thoughtful animal immediately clawed
his way to the boy’s half submerged shoulders and
set up a howl which was as plainly a request for
sympathy and assistance as could be imagined.</p>

<p>“Hang to the pup!” called Jule.</p>

<p>But the dog, showing intelligence beyond his years,
seemed to realize the insecurity of his perch and
sprang for the boat, now advancing swiftly toward
the swimmer. The mob on the pier drew up at the
very edge of the water and contented itself by
showering both boy and dog with a volley of broken
bricks and clubs. Case caught the dog as it struck
the rim of the boat and drew it inside.</p>

<p>By this time Alex was within reaching distance,
and was assisted in, his clothing torn and dripping.
Once in the boat, he turned toward his pursuers,
placed his thumb on the end of his nose, and swung
his four fingers derisively in the air.</p>

<p>“Come on in!” he shouted. “The water’s fine!”</p>

<p>A mixture of blackguard English, Spanish, and
Indian, accompanied by another volley of bricks
was the only answer. Then, having expressed his
indifference to the attacks of the mob, Alex turned
his attention to Frank, who was soon drawn out of
the water. The dog was the first one on the deck
of the <i>Rambler</i>.</p>

<p>“Start her up,” Alex grinned. “There’s more
coming.”</p>
 </div>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chIX'>CHAPTER IX.—AN ALARM IN THE NIGHT</h2>

<p class='first'>“Now you’ve gone and got us into another row!”
grumbled Case, panting from his long pull at the
oars. “You’ve stirred up the whole city, I guess,”
he continued, as an addition to the mob on the pier
swung around a corner.</p>

<p>“Well, I had to bring the dog, didn’t I?”
demanded Alex, with a most annoying smile. “He’s
my dog. I’ve named him Captain Joe, for the good
old sea captain!”</p>

<p>“It strikes me you’d better get the <i>Rambler</i> out a
little farther,” suggested Jule. “Those muckers on
shore are getting a boat.”</p>

<p>This seemed to be sound advice, for three boats
instead of one were being started away from the
pier. Clay set the motors going at full speed and
headed for the other side of the river. At the same
moment the <i>Señorita</i> shipped anchor and headed
shoreward, with the evident purpose of picking up
the approaching boats.</p>

<p>“Let her out!” advised Alex, patting the wet dog
on the head. “If they catch us, with the help of
that steamer they’ll want my dog.”</p>

<p>“Where did you get the pup?” asked Jule, trying
to make friends with Captain Joe, a heavy, ugly,
red-eyed, white bulldog about a year old.</p>

<p>“Bought him,” replied Alex, “and then they
tried to steal him away from me. You’d better get a
move on, Clay!”</p>

<p>The <i>Rambler</i> was now headed up the river at her
best speed, and the <i>Señorita</i> soon dropped back. As
she turned to take up her old position Captain Joe,
who seemed to understand that he was now a dog
of great importance, put his paws upon the railing
and barked an insulting farewell to her and the
members of the mob she was taking on board.</p>

<p>“That’s a fine dog,” said Jule.</p>

<p>“You bet he is!” asserted Alex. “I saw him
doing tricks up in town and bought him of a boy, and
then an old man came along and claimed him, and I
bought the dog of him, and then another man came
along and said the dog was his, and I bought him
again, and then another man came along and said the
dog was his, and I bought him again, and then
another man came——”</p>

<p>“To be continued in our next!” shouted Jule.
“Serves you good and right for going off without
me. Now, tell us what took place.”</p>

<p>“Why,” Alex went on, making a wry face at the
<i>Señorita</i> as the <i>Rambler</i> shot around a point of land
and was slowed down a trifle, “I’m telling you
about it. I bought Captain Joe off a boy, and a
man came along and claimed him, and I bought him
off him, and then another man came along and
claimed the dog, and I bought him——”</p>

<p>Jule chased Alex and his dog into the cabin and
left them there to recover from the effects of their
bath.</p>

<p>“That lad certainly needs a mental tonic!” he
exclaimed, as he went on deck again.</p>

<p>“I don’t doubt that he is telling the exact truth, in
his whimsical way, of course,” Frank argued, in
defense of his friend. “That is an old trick in this
country. You buy something of one man and
another claims it. Alex would have been buying that
dog yet if he had remained on shore. He just had
to run for it or lose the dog.”</p>

<p>“He needs a dog about as much as I need a cupola
on top of my head,” Case put in.</p>

<p>“I don’t see how we’ve got along without a dog as
long as we have,” grinned Jule.</p>

<p>“What sort of a river is this Para stream?”
asked Case, as the <i>Rambler</i> pressed on through what
seemed to be a lake anywhere from ten to fifteen
miles in width, with a row of long islands hugging
the south shore.</p>

<p>“No river at all,” Frank replied. “It is merely
an estuary, as you will see when the Atlantic tide
meets the current coming down from the west. And
the river that runs into this estuary isn’t the Para at
all. It is the Tocantins, a stream a thousand miles
long. Why this body of water is put down on the
maps as the Para river is more than I can say.”</p>

<p>About dark, after a run of sixty or seventy miles,
the boys came to the island which sits at the mouth
of the Tocantins river. At nine in the evening they
anchored in front of Cameta, which is a small town
on the west side of the Tocantins. Here they
decided to spend the night.</p>

<p>“It seems like we were never going to get to the
Amazon,” Jule complained, as the lights of the town
vanished for the night.</p>

<p>“We are still at least two hundred miles from the
Amazon,” Frank replied. “Across there, to the
North, is Marajo island. We will sail along on this
side of it all day to-morrow, probably, on an estuary
fully as wide as that we have been following. Then
we will come to a region of bayous from 50 to 100
yards in width. There are trees two hundred feet
high in there, and the forest is so thick with tangled
vines that one can scarcely get through it. Then
we will come out on the Amazon, not far from
Gurupa, a place of some importance. Then, after we
pass the mouth of the Xingu river, we will be fairly
on our way to the foot of the Andes.”</p>

<p>“Well, hurry up!” broke in Alex, snapping his
fingers at Captain Joe, “this honorable puppy wants
to get his paws into the earth again.”</p>

<p>For two days the boys sat under an awning which
had been spread over the hot forward deck and
feasted their city-bred eyes on the luxuriance of the
tropical forest. It was all new and strange to them.
In some places the boughs of the great trees met
over their heads, making a green bower of the
bayou through which they were passing.</p>

<p>Now and then a native Indian glided past them in
a canoe made of some light wood. These natives are
dark as negroes, but their hair is long and straight.
They are not at all warlike.</p>

<p>The night before reaching the Amazon the boys
tied up in a bayou and put all lights out early.</p>

<p>“If the <i>Señorita</i> is sneaking along after us,” Clay
said, “we must know it. This is as good a place to
fight it out as any other.”</p>

<p>“They will never fight it out in the open,” Frank
declared, moodily. “They will wait for a chance to
blow us out of water, or to knife us from behind.”</p>

<p>The <i>Rambler</i> was dark and still at midnight, and
Alex was on watch, on the forward deck with Captain Joe
sniffing the heavy air at his side.</p>

<p>“What do you see, old boy?” asked Alex, as the
dog ran, whining, toward the prow.</p>

<p>Captain Joe lowered his ugly-looking muzzle and
appeared to be looking down into the water. Alex
groped about in the darkness for an instant and then
called Clay, speaking very softly, “so as not to queer
the act that is coming on,” he explained.</p>

<p>“What is it?” whispered Clay, as the two
crouched in the prow, looking into the dark bayou.</p>

<p>“Watch the dog,” advised Alex.</p>

<p>Captain Joe appeared to be quivering from nose
to the tip end of his stumpy tail. His ears were
lifted as Alex patted his head, and his teeth snapped
between snarling lips. He whined softly as Alex
restrained him from jumping into the dark water.</p>

<p>“There’s an Indian about,” Alex whispered. “I
bought him of an up-river Indian he seemed afraid
of, and every time we’ve passed one he’s acted like
this. Seems as if the Indian he’s scenting is in the
water—probably swimming toward the boat.”</p>

<p>While the two stood there in silence, listening for
some ripple of water to give them the location of the
prowler, the quick, sharp ring of a steamer’s exhaust
came to their ears. They listened for what seemed
to them to be a long time, but the sounds came no
nearer.</p>

<p>“That’s the <i>Señorita</i>,” Clay commented, “and she
is undoubtedly waiting back there in some bay for a
report from the mucker who has been sent on ahead
to see what the prospects for a midnight murder
are.”</p>

<p>Captain Joe was growing more uneasy every
minute, and Alex was having a hard time holding
him. His sharp claws were making too much noise
on the deck, and the boy tried to throw him over on
his side.</p>

<p>“Lie still!” he commanded, but Captain Joe had
other notions of what was best to do under the
circumstances. He wiggled away from the boy’s hands
in the dark and sprang into the water.</p>

<p>“Now you’ve done it!” gritted Alex. “Wait
until I get you back on the boat!”</p>

<p>There was now a great splashing in the water,
terminating in a shriek of terror and pain, and Clay
turned his searchlight on the scene of the
disturbance. Two heads were seen bobbing about in the
water, one of an Indian, the other of the dog.</p>

<p>“Get him, Captain Joe!” cried Alex, overlooking
all caution in the excitement of the moment.</p>

<p>There was a plunge and a cry and both heads
disappeared. Directly the flashlight showed the dog’s
head on the surface, swimming toward the boat.
The Indian was nowhere in sight.</p>

<p>“He dove under and got away from the puppy,”
Alex explained, as he leaned far over the side of
the boat to assist Captain Joe on deck. “Did you
lose him, old boy?” he asked patting the dog on
the head.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid not,” Clay observed, turning his light
on the dog and disclosing bloody water dropping
away from the jaws.</p>

<p>Alex bent over his pet and saw a long knife
wound on the shoulder.</p>

<p>“They sure got together in the water,” he said.
“I guess that is a good Indian now!”</p>

<p>“It is a terrible thing to take a human life,” Clay
said. “I hope the poor fellow got away.”</p>

<p>“So he can come back some other night when
we’re not watching!” cried Alex. “If he hadn’t
been trying to get us he wouldn’t have been here, and
wouldn’t have been hurt.”</p>

<p>Captain Joe moved back to the cabin and lay down
to lick his hurt.</p>

<p>“You’ll have to keep him chained,” Clay
suggested, with a smile at the interested face of the boy.</p>

<p>“Huh!” cried Alex. “You keep your old Indians
chained!”</p>

<p>There was another long silence. The flashlights
were off, and the dog lay asleep at the cabin door.
Then the puff-puff of a steamer was in the air, and
the sound of churning water. As the boys listened
the sounds grew fainter.</p>

<p>“They’ve gone back,” Alex ventured. “They’ve
given up all hope of getting us to-night. I wonder
why they are after Frank, and why he is so
close-mouthed about the matter?”</p>

<p>“Whatever the difficulty is,” Clay said, “there is
likely to be more incidents like this before we get
back to the South Branch.”</p>

<p>“Are you going to stop at Gurupa?” asked Alex,
disappointed at the reticence of the other.</p>

<p>“We must have more gasoline,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Why, we filled the tanks at Para!”</p>

<p>“Just so, but one of the tanks sprung a leak,
and we’ve got just about half enough for our
needs.”</p>

<p>Alex gave a low whistle of amazement.</p>

<p>“And we’ve got too little money to let it run out
of the tanks without getting us anywhere,” he said.</p>

<p>“When we fill the tanks,” Clay said, dejectedly,
“we’ll be just about out of money.”</p>

<p>Another long whistle from Alex.</p>

<p>“What are we going to do?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Just keep on going.”</p>

<p>“But we can’t run without gasoline.”</p>

<p>“We’ll have to take in some sort of a cargo and
trade along the river,” suggested Clay. “We may
be able to get through in that way.”</p>

<p>“It will be fun!” exclaimed Alex.</p>

<p>“We might sell Captain Joe,” hinted Clay, with
a laugh, “if we could find anyone to buy him.”</p>

<p>“I guess not!” exclaimed Alex, indignantly.
“If it hadn’t been for Captain Joe we might all
have been murdered in our beds!” No, sir; we’ll
starve before we’ll sell Captain Joe!”</p>

<p>Clay chuckled, respecting the boy’s loyalty to the
dog, and nothing more was said on the subject.</p>

<p>The remainder of the night passed without
incident, except that the occasional exhaust of steam
told the boys that the <i>Señorita</i>, or some other
meddlesome craft, was lying in the darkness to the
south. In the morning, however, there were no
signs of the pursuing boat.</p>

<p>Shortly before noon the next day the <i>Rambler</i>
passed out of the narrow bayou she had been
following and speeded out on the Amazon, the river of
their dreams! It is needless to say that the boys
opened their eyes wide at sight of the famous
stream, which is dotted with islands at that point,
looking more like a lake than a river. It is so
wide that the shores are only dimly seen from the
center of the current.</p>

<p>In the afternoon they reached the little harbor
where they were to buy gasoline. When, after some
haggling and unnecessary delay, the motors were
started again, Clay looked very sober.</p>

<p>“We’re broke,” he announced. “If we get any
more gasoline we’ve got to earn it, in some way.”</p>

<p>To the credit of the boys be it said that they
received the announcement with due gravity, but
refused to be much depressed by it. They declared
that they could earn more money, never stopping to
think that they were in South America and not in
Chicago!</p>

<p>Straight to the west the mighty river lay,
stretching to the blue skyline. They passed the
Trombetas on the third day, and towards night
came to the Madeira, into which Frank, who was at
the wheel, directed the prow of the <i>Rambler</i>.</p>

<p>“Where might you be going, Frank?” Jule asked
as, after half an hour, the boy turned the <i>Rambler</i>
into a little creek perhaps five miles away from the
mouth of the Madeira. “Which of the big streams
that met back a ways is the Amazon?”</p>

<p>“This is the Madeira,” Frank replied. “It is not
as long as the Amazon, but it is some river for all
that. I don’t know that this creek has any name, but
that won’t prevent us tying up for the night here.
I’ve a sort of affection for this place. You see,
boys,” he added, a grim smile on his face, “I stopped
here on the way down from Peru. I wasn’t exactly
looking for sport here, either! While here at that
time, I saw something that caused me to think we
might pick up a cargo here now—something we can
turn into gasoline and such tinned goods as we need.
From now on, of course, we can get most of our
food from the river and forest, as fish and game are
plenty. I’ll show you our dessert, directly.”</p>

<p>The <i>Rambler</i> was soon anchored for the night in
the creek, but the boys did not build a “cook” fire
on shore, as the wild tangle of undergrowth came
down to the edge of the creek. While Case was
frying bacon and eggs and making coffee, Frank went
ashore in the row-boat, “after dessert,” he said, the
motor boat having been anchored at least thirty feet
from the bank. When he returned he carried an
armful of green, tough-looking things, each
weighing not far from two pounds. He passed one to
each of his chums and sat grinning as they made
cautious examinations and asked questions about
the “fruit.”</p>

<p>“They are custard apples,” he said, after the boys
had guessed for a time. “The natives call ’em
chirimoya. Some of them weigh ten pounds. See,
it is a pie, already made,” he added, breaking open
one of the “apples.”</p>

<p>Inside was a delicious soft pulp, thickly sown with
black seeds. It reminded the boys of the Indiana
pawpaw. Jule said it was a banana, pine-apple, pear
and strawberry all in one. Several were consumed
that night and more collected for the next day.</p>

<p>“Besides these,” Frank said, opening a second
“apple pie,” as he called it, “we’ll find something
worth while here.”</p>
 </div>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chX'>CHAPTER X.—A CAMPFIRE IN THE JUNGLE</h2>

<p class='first'>“What do you mean by something worth
while?” demanded Alex, busy with pancakes at the
electric stove.</p>

<p>“It probably isn’t a dog!” laughed Jule.</p>

<p>“You let Captain Joe alone,” commanded Alex,
“or I’ll instruct him to make a supper of you. He’s
some dog!”</p>

<p>“Where can any cargo procured here be disposed
of?” asked Clay, hopefully, remembering the empty
purse.</p>

<p>“There’s a little town up the river where vessels
bound for Europe take on cargoes,” Frank
explained, with a knowing smile, “and we may find
something we can get rid of if we tell them we need
the money.”</p>

<p>“We need the money, fast enough,” Case
grumbled. “If someone hadn’t let the gasoline run
away we’d have plenty now! Wonder it didn’t set
fire to the boat!”</p>

<p>“Growl, bear, growl!” laughed Jule.</p>

<p>“Whose heard anything of the <i>Señorita</i> to-day?”
asked Case, as they all lounged on the forward deck
after supper.</p>

<p>“I think she must have gone back,” Clay
answered. “I haven’t seen or heard her for two
days.”</p>

<p>“She hasn’t gone back,” Frank insisted. “She
will follow us to the foothills, unless something
unusual stops her. We are getting into her home
territory now, and may expect trouble.”</p>

<p>“What is all this about?” asked Jule. “Why so
mysterious?”</p>

<p>Frank did not answer, and the boy continued:</p>

<p>“I wish the <i>Señorita</i> had blown up on the South
Branch.”</p>

<p>“How would you like to be on the South Branch
to-night?” asked Case.</p>

<p>“This suits me well enough,” was Jule’s answer.
“If there’s any need of a guard to-night, who’s in
for it?” he added, looking about for more dessert.
Frank was on his feet in a moment.</p>

<p>“I will watch to-night,” he said. “On the way
down from Peru, as I told you, I stopped here for a
couple of days, and I think, as I said before, I know
where we can find something that looks like money,
if we watch closely to-night.”</p>

<p>The boys looked over the darkling scene, over the
narrow stream, over the broad Madeira, perhaps two
hundred yards away, over the forest, crowding down
to the rim of the little creek, and Case echoed the
sentiments of all the rest when he asked:</p>

<p>“What in the world is there in here that we can
get money for?”</p>

<p>“If we had some of this scenery on the Chicago
wood market, now,” Jule laughed, waving a hand
over the landscape, which showed trees more than
two hundred feet high, “we might be able to do
business on a cash basis, but I don’t see any
sustenance in this.”</p>

<p>“It strikes me that you took a queer location for
your resting-place on the way out,” Alex put in.</p>

<p>“Over there, a few hundred yards,” Frank
explained, “I found a pretty fair hotel—in a tree! It
seemed to me, at that time to be about the neatest,
coziest little hotel on earth!”</p>

<p>“Hotel?” repeated Clay, wondering if the
strange boy was at last about to talk of the mystery
which surrounded him, after a silence of weeks.</p>

<p>“You see,” Frank continued, “when I came down
the river I had—well, I had something in my
possession which—there was something the other
people wanted, you understand. They had followed me
pretty closely from Cloud island, and I thought I’d
drop in here and let them go by.”</p>

<p>“And they did?” asked Clay, disappointed at the
guarded tone of the boy. “Did they go by?”</p>

<p>“After three days,” was the reply. “It was while
I was hiding in the tree hotel I’ve been telling you
about that I saw—well, that I came upon—or,
rather, that I arranged for the cargo that we may be
able to turn into money—when we come to the ships
that are going to Europe!”</p>

<p>“I’d like to know what you’re talking about!”
exclaimed Alex. “There is about as much coherence
to your explanation as there is to a railroad freight
schedule. What was it you ‘arranged for?’”</p>

<p>“Where is Cloud island?” demanded Jule, not
waiting for the boy to reply.</p>

<p>Frank flushed, as if caught in some dishonorable
evasion of the truth, and remained silent.</p>

<p>“How long will it take to get this may-be cargo
out?” asked Clay, as much to break the painful
silence as for any other purpose.</p>

<p>“Not very long,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Can we do it in the night?” asked Jule. “Say,
but I’d like to go into that jungle in the night!”</p>

<p>“Then we’ll take Captain Joe and go,” asserted
Alex.</p>

<p>Captain Joe wagged his stumpy tail as if
seconding the proposition, and Alex began telling him
what a fine gentleman of a dog he was. Captain Joe
had already begun to fill out, he having been half
starved at the time Alex rescued him, and was now
a powerful fellow and as playful as a kitten. The
boys were teaching him to do all sorts of
tricks.</p>

<p>“You’d better keep the dog on the boat,” Frank
warned. “He’ll only bark and attract attention to
us.”</p>

<p>“In that wilderness!” ejaculated Case. “Who is
there in that bunch of tall timber to hear a dog
bark?”</p>

<p>The boys talked over the proposed night visit to
the jungle while they finished supper and washed
and set away the dishes. Frank seemed to be of the
opinion that he could best do what was to be done
alone, though the others scoffed at the notion of his
bringing out, single handed, anything that might be
traded for gasoline and tinned goods!</p>

<p>It was finally decided that Case should go with
Frank, and that the other boys should remain on the
boat and listen for such signals as the shore party
might send out. If help was needed in moving what
Frank vaguely referred to as “his cargo,” one long
call was to be the signal; if there was danger, three
long calls.</p>

<p>The waters of the creek would carry the motor
boat only in the middle of the current, for the
shores, besides sloping over shallows, were here and
there lined with fallen tree-trunks.</p>

<p>“It looks like ruination!” Alex commented, as
the row-boat was made ready, and from that
moment the stream was known as “Ruination Creek.”</p>

<p>Clay rowed the two boys ashore, saw that they
were provided with automatic revolvers and
flashlights, and then took the boat back to the <i>Rambler</i>.
It was left ready for instant use, however, with
weapons and flashlights on the stern seat.</p>

<p>“There’s something strange about that boy
Frank,” Jule commented, as the two boys
disappeared in what seemed from the boat to be a solid
wall of green foliage, their flashlights showing only
dimly through the heavy undergrowth. “I don’t
understand him at all. What kind of a cargo can
he get in there in the darkness? And what is
keeping him from telling us all about it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t quite understand why he should make
a mystery of the proposed cargo, as we are all equally
interested with himself in the matter,” Clay
admitted. “I don’t see why he shouldn’t be as
confidential with us as we have always been with him.
He has never explained to my satisfaction why he
was hanging around the warehouse in the rain that
night on the South Branch.”</p>

<p>“Why, he was lonesome, and homesick, and
anxious to go along with us, yet afraid to ask,”
interposed Alex. “Anyway, he’ll tell us when he
gets good and ready. Don’t let’s knock!”</p>

<p>“That’s slang!” Jule shouted. “You wash
dishes!”</p>

<p>“Is that slang, Clay?” asked Alex.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s a short and vigorous way of
expressing a sensible admonition, so we may as well let
it go,” Clay replied.</p>

<p>“Sensible admonition! I’ll write that down!”
laughed Jule.</p>

<p>“And the finding of the diamonds! And the
newspaper with the penciled hand pointing to the
advertisement offering the $500 reward for the
return of the gems,” Clay went on, “is another
strange thing. Who could have placed the marked
newspaper where it was found? You remember,
Jule, that the lawyer who paid over the reward asked
me how the newspaper came to be there, and I
couldn’t tell him!”</p>

<p>“No one had been ashore that morning except
Frank,” Jule said, “and he went away early, and
might have sneaked back with the paper. It wasn’t
there the night before. It sure was either Frank or
Captain Joe who put the paper there.”</p>

<p>Captain Joe, the dog, worthy representative of a
staunch old friend, put his chin on Alex’s knee, at
mention of his name, and wagged his tail as if
promising to unravel the whole mystery as soon as
he got time!</p>

<p>“I wish someone would offer a reward now that
we could get,” Jule grinned. “I think we could use
a little old reward about now. Anyway, I don’t see
where all our $200 and the $500 reward went to.
We must have been tossing money to the birds!”</p>

<p>Clay and Alex looked at each other with glances
of understanding. Jule had never been told of the
loss of the money.</p>

<p>“Funny about that reward coming just at the
time it did, and just as it did,” began Alex, but here
a great chattering in the jungle cut the conversation
short. There was such a rustling in the foliage, now
invisible in the blackness of the night, and such a
medley of whisperings and shrill cries that the boys
involuntarily reached for their weapons. Then Jule
laughed and turned on the prow light, for they had
been sitting in the darkness.</p>

<p>“You’ll see ’em in a second,” he told the others,
winking the light on and off to attract more
attention. “There’s a brigade of Brazilian monkeys in
there, and the boys have stirred them up with their
lights and noise.”</p>

<p>“I doubt if we’ll get a look at them,” Clay
corrected, “for the Brazilian monkeys are shy little
chaps. Even Captain Joe seems to understand that
they will not be at home to callers to-night,” he
added, as the dog wagged his tail and lay down
again.</p>

<p>As the two explorers in the forest passed farther
from the creek the protests of the monkeys died out,
and all was reasonably still again. Clay moved over
by the light switch so that Jule could not turn it on
again, as he considered it safer to sit in the darkness.
The bright prow light made too good a mark for a
hostile gun, he thought.</p>

<p>While Clay, Alex, and Jule waited on the
forward deck of the <i>Rambler</i>, still discussing the
incomprehensible actions and silences of Frank, that young
man, accompanied by Case, was plunging through
the thickets lying south of Ruination Creek. Back
of them rolled the Amazon, only a short distance
away. To the east lay the Madeira, to the west the
level plain ending only at the Andes.</p>

<p>They had proceeded perhaps half a mile when
Frank stopped in a little opening and looked about
with expectant eyes. The noises of the forest were
all about them. Birds, suddenly awakened from
sleep, cried out to each other from treetops, and
hidden things scurried along under the dense foliage
which everywhere concealed the rich black earth.</p>

<p>“It was right here somewhere,” Frank said, “that
I found the tree hotel, and it is right about here
that we’ll get the cargo if we get it at all. Do you
smell anything unusual?” he added, sniffing the air.</p>

<p>“Only wood burning.”</p>

<p>“Well, that means a campfire!”</p>

<p>“But who would be building a campfire in
this wilderness?” demanded Case. “Perhaps the
chimney of your hotel smokes!” he added, laughingly.</p>

<p>“That is for us to find out!” Frank replied, and
Case detected a tone of anxiety in his voice. “If
anyone has been in here, looking around, why, my
cargo——”</p>

<p>“What about your cargo?” asked Case, as the
other stopped suddenly.</p>

<p>“Why, it will be gone,” Frank admitted, in a
moment.</p>

<p>Directly Case caught his companion by the arm
and pointed straight ahead into the jungle.</p>

<p>“There is where the smoke comes from,” he
explained. “There’s a fire in the thicket yonder, and
men moving around it.”</p>

<p>Frank followed the direction of the pointing hand
and grasped his companion by the arm.</p>

<p>“We may as well go back,” he whispered.
“Those men are here because they know about my
cargo. If we move silently, they will not know that
we are here. Come along! They must not see me
to-night!”</p>

<p>“I’ve got to know something more about this
cargo before I give up hope of getting it,” Case
declared, stubbornly. “I’m not going to miss a
chance of getting the money we need for any little
interruption like this. Who are those men? Why
are you afraid to let them see you here? Do you
know why they are here? Ever see them before?”</p>

<p>“Why, it is too dark to see their faces,” Frank
explained, hesitatingly, “and we couldn’t tell friend
from foe at that distance, anyway,” he added. “But
the fact that they are here is enough for me to
know! Come along! We’re going back to the
<i>Rambler</i> now, we can come again in the morning.”</p>

<p>“That’s the trouble with you!” Case whispered,
reprovingly. “You are too much of a quitter!</p>

<p>You were afraid to come on board the <i>Rambler</i>,
that night on the South Branch. Now you’re afraid
to go on, because you see two men standing by a
campfire! Well, I don’t know where your cargo is,
or what it is, and you all say I’m a kicker and a
prophet of evil, but I’m going on in and find out
why those men are camping in this jungle.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry you’ve got such a bad opinion of me,”
Frank said, slowly. “Perhaps you may change
your mind, in time. As for going in there, I’ll go,
if you insist upon it, but I’m telling you now that
you will regret it if you do.”</p>

<p>The fire died down a bit, and the figures which
had stood before it were no longer in sight. The
boys shut off their lights, took firmer hold of their
weapons, and stood considering.</p>

<p>But the decision was not with them, for while
they pondered two forms rose up behind them and
they were thrown to the ground.</p>
 </div>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chXI'>CHAPTER XI.—A HUMAN GUARD WITH HORNS</h2>

<p class='first'>Case and Frank were not permitted to lie on the
ground long after being seized from behind and
thrown down. Frank’s searchlight was taken from
his hand and directed upon his face.</p>

<p>“Humph!” grunted a rumbling voice.</p>

<p>“Only a kid!” grumbled a man who was looking
over the shoulder of the one who held the light, at
the same time holding Case to the earth with a
heavy knee.</p>

<p>When the light shifted Frank saw two burly
figures with thick breasts and short necks, with
faces masked by great straggling beards. The men
were dirty and unkempt, and their clothes were torn
into tatters, probably, the boy thought, by contract
with the jungle.</p>

<p>The lads struggled in vain. Their weapons were
taken from them and then they were hustled toward
the fire they had observed from the bush. It was a
roaring fire, built of some gum-running wood, and
the heat and smoke of it well-nigh blistered the faces
of the prisoners and stifled their breath.</p>

<p>After being roughly searched, the captives were
bundled against the bole of a great tree which stood
some distance from the fire. They were so dazed at
what had taken place, at the tragic change of
situation, that at first they did not sense what was going
on around them. Then they saw as hideous an
object as they had ever set their eyes on bending so
close to the fire that it seemed to them that the flesh
must be cooking on his repulsive face.</p>

<p>One of the men gave this object a stout push in
a moment and sent him whirling in the direction of
the tree.</p>

<p>“Watch ’em, Ugly!” he ordered, and the object
settled down on his haunches and glared at the
prisoners until it seemed that the evil eyes must pop
out of his head.</p>

<p>The creature who had been called “Ugly”
certainly appeared to merit the name. He was of
medium height, black as a negro, but with straight,
black hair, which was knotted and tangled until it
resembled a net complicated by nature as well as by
human hands. The boys knew from the looks of
the mass that it had recently been anointed with
some kind of grease, and that it held an odor all its
own.</p>

<p>But the most striking thing about the stolid face
which now leered at them over the barrel of an
automatic rifle which lay in the fellow’s lap was its
seeming growth of horns. There were three of these, one
at the fullness of the under lip, and two just above
the corners of the cruel upper lip. These horns gave
the fellow’s face something of the appearance of
such representations of Mephisto as the boys had
seen in plays.</p>

<p>“No, that is not the Old Nick!” Frank whispered
to Case, well knowing what was in the disturbed
mind of his companion in captivity, “that is a Mura
Indian, ornamented according to an ancient custom
of his people. He belongs to a peaceful tribe, and
may not be as fierce as he looks.”</p>

<p>“Would he shoot if we made a break for the
tall timber?”</p>

<p>“Probably.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to knock those horns down his throat!”
Case growled. “He has no right to keep us here.
Would the horns grow out again if I should knock
’em off?”</p>

<p>Even in the serious plight the boys were in, Frank
could not keep from chuckling at this, for the horns
were of wood, and were held in place by being
pushed through the flesh from the inside. When
this was explained to Case his comment was that he
would enjoy having the job of fixing the things on.</p>

<p>“He’d have a sore face for a time,” Case declared,
“just like I did when I had my teeth filled. We’ve
got to get away from him in some way. “We’ll be
murdered if we remain here, and we can only die in
an attempt to get back to the <i>Rambler</i>.”</p>

<p>“We may have to make a run for it in time,”
Frank answered, “but we may as well wait until
we know more about what our capture means. I
understand something of the Mura dialect, and will
talk with him when I get a chance.”</p>

<p>“Go on and do it now,” urged Case. “I’d like to
know what this pretty little scene is all about. What
are those Englishmen doing in here, anyway, and
what are they muttering about over there by the
fire?”</p>

<p>Frank did not reply, for he was asking himself
the very same question without finding any answer.</p>

<p>“Perhaps they’re here after your cargo,” suggested Case.</p>

<p>Frank shrugged his shoulders despairingly.</p>

<p>“That may be,” he admitted. “That is what I fear!”</p>

<p>“Could they carry it away without a boat?”</p>

<p>“Y-e-s,” Frank admitted, slowly. “Besides, they
may have a boat.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to know what kind of a cargo you’re
talking about,” said Case, half-angrily. “It can’t
be much if two men could carry it through these
jungles in their naked hands.”</p>

<p>He looked Frank questioningly in the face as he
spoke, but the latter did not fall into the trap. He
maintained his accustomed silence regarding the
character of the cargo he had entered the thicket to
find.</p>

<p>“Ask him what he’ll take to let us go?” suggested Case, directly.</p>

<p>“We haven’t got anything to give,” objected
Frank. “You can’t bribe a fellow with hot air.”</p>

<p>“If I could,” replied Case, sniffing at the heat of
the fire and the heat of the heavy air that breathed
out of the forest, “I could do some bribing. But
this chap would rather have one of our searchlights
than own the First National Bank of Chicago. Try
him on that!”</p>

<p>“We haven’t got any searchlights,” answered
Frank, dejectedly, taking note of their electrics in
the ham-like hands of their captors. “Those men
have taken them. They seem to be preparing to
leave, and perhaps I’ll soon have a chance to talk
with Ugly, as they call him. See! The men are
pointing toward the boat I suppose they’ll be going
there next.”</p>

<p>“I hope the boys will give them a red-hot reception!”
Case exclaimed in so loud a tone that one of
the Englishmen turned and scowled in that direction.</p>

<p>“What you lads grumbling about?” he demanded.
“If you want to keep whole heads on
your necks, you’d better stow that chin. Ugly is a
bit nervous to-night, and his gun might go off.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do with us?” asked
Case, as calmly as the nature of the occasion would
admit of.</p>

<p>“Keep you for pets!” roared the fellow, impatiently.</p>

<p>“This object in front of us looks to me like the
kind of a pet a tough like you would want,” Case
answered, angrily.</p>

<p>The two men whispered together for a moment,
paying no attention to the retort, and then one of
them asked:</p>

<p>“How much petrol have you in your tanks?”</p>

<p>Case eyed the speaker with no little curiosity. His
figure and dress, his lack of any orderly
arrangement of his ragged garments, told him that he
belonged to the lower grade of Englishmen, still his
speech and manner indicated no little degree of
refinement.</p>

<p>“What’s petrol?” he asked, not that he needed
information on the subject, but to keep the other
talking.</p>

<p>“You call it gasoline in this blawsted country,”
said the other. “How much have you in the tanks
of the <i>Rambler</i>?”</p>

<p>“What’s it to you?” asked the boy. “You’re
not going to get the boat. If you go within reach
of the boys’ guns they’ll blow the tops of your ugly
heads off. Go on, if you want to! You’ll see!”</p>

<p>“We really need a boat!” laughed the fellow.
“And so,” he added, “we’ll take our chances and
leave you to the polite attentions of Ugly while we
go and get the <i>Rambler</i>, with your permission, of
course!”</p>

<p>“Where is your own boat?” demanded Case.
“Why do you have to steal ours. You aren’t river
pirates, are you?”</p>

<p>“Never you mind what we are, sonny,” laughed
the Englishman, “and never you mind about our
boat. Perhaps, you know, we lost it on a reef at
Cloud island!” he added, glancing keenly at Frank.</p>

<p>Frank dropped his eyes, showing either
embarrassment or lack of courage, Case could not
determine which. Once before, when Cloud island had
been thoughtlessly brought into the conversation by
the boy himself he had shown great confusion.
There must be some mystery about Cloud island, was
Case’s conclusion, some mystery of which the
Englishman as well as the boy had knowledge!</p>

<p>Plainly the name of the island had been used to
bring to the boy’s mind some unpleasant recollection,
for it had not been necessary, in mentioning the loss
of a boat, to refer to the island at all. Therefore,
Case reasoned, the name meant something to the
Englishman as well as to Frank, and the reference to
it had been designed to warn or threaten the boy.
He resolved to know more about Cloud island as
soon as he found an opportunity to talk with Frank!
In the meantime, he might be able to get something
of a clue from the Englishman.</p>

<p>“What do you know about Cloud island?” he
asked. “I don’t believe you’ve ever been there.
You’re only river thieves!”</p>

<p>The Englishman, not at all angry at the epithet,
glanced keenly at Frank, as if asking a question with
his eyes, and the boy, who remained silent, studied
the bearded face intently.</p>

<p>“I know enough about it, lad,” was the significant
reply, made directly to Frank, although he had not
spoken at all.</p>

<p>“Are you going there?” continued Case. “To
Cloud island I mean?”</p>

<p>“What else do you think I’m being roasted and
eaten alive by insects in this blawsted wilderness
for?” asked the other.</p>

<p>“Then why don’t you move on and let us alone?”
asked Case.</p>

<p>“All in good time, lad, all in good time!”</p>

<p>“We’re going to move on up the river as soon
as you go down,” grunted the other Englishman,
looking significantly at Frank.</p>

<p>With this declaration, which seemed to amount to
a threat, the fellow turned to his companion and the
two, after conferring together in whispers for a
short time and giving the Indian instructions in a
tongue unknown to Case, plunged into the thicket,
taking the general direction in which the <i>Rambler</i>
lay.</p>

<p>“Now ask Ugly what this is all about!” directed
Case, as the backs of the two men disappeared from
the ring of light given out by the fire.</p>

<p>Frank had little trouble in understanding the
Indian, and the latter seemed willing to talk, so all
the fellow knew of the purposes and movements of
the Englishmen was soon in the possession of the
boy. But the Indian watched the boys closely as he
talked, keeping his automatic trained on them. He
evidently stood in deadly fear of the Englishmen,
and was resolved to do their bidding, even if murder
resulted.</p>

<p>“The Englishmen engaged him as guide,” Frank
interpreted to Case, “to take them to Cloud island,
at the headwaters of the Amazon. They lost their
boat some distance below, and are determined to take
possession of the <i>Rambler</i>. He is to shoot us if we
try to get away, and is to have his ears cut off and his
nose pulled out by the roots if he does not obey
orders. That’s all.”</p>

<p>“That’s enough, I think!” Case commented.
“But they can’t get the boat! The boys are there,
and will put up a fight for it.”</p>

<p>“The Englishmen will do their best, because they
want to turn us back. Failing in this, they will kill
us if they can.”</p>

<p>“Look here!” Case demanded. “What is this all
about? Have you ever seen those men before?
Where is Cloud island? What mutual understanding
concerning it lies between you and these men?
You may as well tell me, for I’ll have it out of you.”</p>

<p>Frank gave unsatisfactory replies, and a sullen
silence fell between the two chums.</p>

<p>“I wonder if they will find the boys asleep when
they get to the <i>Rambler</i>?” Frank asked, anxiously,
after a time. This was no time for anger between
them.</p>

<p>“They surely won’t!” answered Case. “If they
do find the boys asleep they’ll find Captain Joe there
with the goods I Say,” the boy added, “I’ve a good
notion to take a hop-step-and-jump for the <i>Rambler</i>.
I could get there before they did, and make it a
sure thing that the boys would not be asleep. I
believe it is worth trying.”</p>

<p>“Ugly would put half a dozen bullets into you
before you got a dozen feet away,” Frank objected.
“See! He’s suspicious of us now.”</p>

<p>“He hears something in the forest back of us,”
Case observed. “I wonder if he will shoot if I
turn around to see what it is? It might be a wild
animal, you know.”</p>

<p>“Watch him! Watch Ugly!”</p>

<p>Frank uttered the cry as he arose to his feet and
pointed with one hand toward the guard, now also
standing on his feet, the gun lying on the ground.
There was a look of terror on the man’s ugly face
which would have been comical if it had not been so
expressive of abject horror. The fellow’s eyes
“hung out like a hat pin,” as Case afterwards
expressed it, and his mouth dropped agape, as if there
were no strength in the fellow to control the action
of his jaws.</p>

<p>“For the love of Madge!” cried Frank. “What
does the man see?”</p>

<p>“I’m not going to stop to answer that question!”
Case replied. “It’s me for the <i>Rambler</i>!”</p>

<p>Ugly did not even notice the lads as they started
away. He stood perfectly still for an instant, then
turned and ran, diving head first into the thicket as
a swimmer dives into an oncoming breaker. Case
and Frank paused by the fire and looked back, to
discover, if possible, the danger from which the
fellow had flown. What they saw was a face and a
hand of fire, lifting from the ground, behind the
tree, pointing and nodding in the direction Ugly had
taken.</p>
 </div>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chXII'>CHAPTER XII.—A PLOT AGAINST THE RAMBLER</h2>

<p class='first'>In the meantime, the three boys on the <i>Rambler</i>
were becoming a bit restless, and not a little anxious
too. The Brazilian night was dark, and there was
a whisper of wind in the trees. The water lapped
the shores and the sides of the boat unceasingly, as
if uttering a warning to them to be up and away. It
was almost unbearably hot, too, for they were nearly
under the equator.</p>

<p>“I think I know what the kid is thinking about
when he talks of a cargo,” Alex said, presently.
“He has often talked to me about gathering Brazil
nuts and taking a load out to some shipping point.
They bring good prices in New York.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean these three-cornered nuts?” asked
Jule.</p>

<p>“Sure! The ones you whittle the shells from with
a knife, and find a solid, triangular piece of meat
on the inside. They grow in big clusters which look
like hornets’ nests, and they break open the heads of
the Indians when they fall from the tree. A ton
would bring nearly $400 in Chicago, and that would
help some, especially as we’ll probably get back
there broke and hungry.”</p>

<p>“When did you take up Case’s role of prophet
of evil?” asked Clay.</p>

<p>Alex laughed and said no more at that time.</p>

<p>“I’ve got a better guess than that,” Jule began,
then. “He is going after rubber. They tap trees
and a white sap runs out, and they cook the sap in
smoke, over moulds, and make rubber coats. I’ll
wager he’s got a cache of rubber in there.”</p>

<p>“I wonder where the rubber trees first came
from?” asked Alex.</p>

<p>“Oh, they came down from the mountains.”</p>

<p>This from Jule, who had been reading books
about South America all the way down—books presented by Captain Joe.</p>

<p>“A few million years ago,” Jule went on, glad of
a chance to air his knowledge, “a sort of
Mediterranean sea covered all the Amazon basin. The
mouth of the big river was away up to the west
there, near the foothills. Then the rains of the long
years washed the soil down into the valley, inch
by inch, and the rivers pushed it along until the
continent east of the mountains was formed.”</p>

<p>“Must have taken a long time to wash this
continent down!” yawned Alex.</p>

<p>“I said millions of years, didn’t I?” reproved
Jule. “And the continent isn’t finished yet. Do
you comprehend that, boys? The continent isn’t
finished to-day! Not after millions of years!”</p>

<p>“That’s about the length of time Case and Frank
have been gone!” declared Alex, nudging Clay to
watch Jule display anger at the irrelevant observation.</p>

<p>“The continent won’t be completed for millions
of years,” Jule went on, not at all put out by the
alleged witticism. “The Amazon alone is carrying
enough sediment to the Atlantic every day to
make a cube of earth five hundred feet each way.
How long will it take all the rivers running down
from the Andes to wash the hills into the sea?
Perhaps you can tell me that, Smarty?” he added,
tapping Alex on the head with his open palm,
whereat Captain Joe rolled up his red eyes, though
the boys could not see them in the darkness, and
emitted a series of low growls.</p>

<p>“Where will it all end?” asked Clay, musingly.</p>

<p>“When there are no more mountains,” Jule
answered, proudly, sure of his ground. “The
mountains will be washed into the seas, and the seas
will fill up, and then the world will be finished.”</p>

<p>“I wish this night was finished!” Alex broke in.
“I wish Case and Frank would come back, cargo or
no cargo.”</p>

<p>“I think I’ll go a little way into the forest and
see what they are up to,” Clay suggested, and Alex
and Jule were on their feet in a moment.</p>

<p>“That’s just what we’ll do,” Jule cried. “We
will go look ’em up!”</p>

<p>“But we can’t all go and leave the boat alone.”</p>

<p>“Why, the boat won’t run away!”</p>

<p>“Someone might run away with it, though.”</p>

<p>“Tell you,” Jule suggested, “we’ll leave the
prow light burning, so we can see if anyone goes
near it, and then we won’t go out of sight of the
light. How will that answer?”</p>

<p>“Fine!” Alex panted, trying to pull Captain Joe
back into the cabin. His highness, the dog, did not
relish the notion of being locked up in the hot little
coop while the boys had a run on shore, so he drew
back with all his strength.</p>

<p>Alex won at last, however, and the door was
closed on the indignant bulldog. To speak the
truth, Clay was rather glad that the boys had chosen
to accompany him to the shore, for it was dark and
uncanny in the forest. There was an indication of
rain, though it was in the midst of the dry season,
and a strange odor which they could not account
for came to the nostrils of the lads.</p>

<p>“A Brazilian forest,” Jule said, as they left the
row-boat tied up in a thicket and faced the jungle,
“is about the most mysterious place on the round
earth. Down here where we are, in the basement,
it is always twilight, even at noon of a sunny day.
We see only the stems of plants and creepers and
the boles of the trees. The beauty, the blossoms,
the colors, the magnificence, is all at the top.
Someone said that the only place from which to view a
South American forest in all its glory is from the
top of a mountain, or from an aeroplane.”</p>

<p>“There isn’t much magnificence down here,”
Alex answered. “Here, Jule, what you got in
your clothes that smells like matches, and what
you sneaking off there alone for?”</p>

<p>“Never you mind!” Jule replied. “You just
stick to your guesses and let me alone. I’m going
to give those boys the scare of their lives. I’ll teach
them to go off and stay like this!”</p>

<p>“You stay here!” commanded Clay, but the
mischievous boy was already gone. They heard him
pushing through the underbrush for a time, saw
the round eye of his flashlight as it swept aloft, and
then the jungle was once more still—save for the
natural life within it—and dark.</p>

<p>“Shall we go on in after him?” asked Alex.
“He may get into trouble, and he’s none too strong
yet.”</p>

<p>“I think we would better remain here,” Clay
replied. “If there is danger we will hear the signal
agreed upon.”</p>

<p>“Frank says he remained hidden in a tree in
there for some time,” Alex remarked, then.
“Now, what was he hiding from, and how did he
get down here? If he came in a steamer, and the
steamer was waiting for him outside, that wouldn’t
be hiding at all. Might as well try to hide while
riding on the neck of an elephant!”</p>

<p>“Have you ever thought that Frank may be the
one who put the marked paper on the <i>Rambler</i> that
morning?” asked Clay, irrelevantly.</p>

<p>“Yes, I have thought of that, but why should he
have done it—if he did? If he knew where the
diamonds were, why didn’t he arrange things so he
could secure the reward for himself? He needed
the money badly enough, according to his own
story.”</p>

<p>“But how could he know where the diamonds
were?” asked Clay.</p>

<p>“Well, the person who left the marked paper on
the boat knew where the stones were! You can’t get
away from that! Besides, Frank had been seen
loitering outside, and there had been a motion at
the glass panel of the door just before he showed
himself. Oh, it is all rather suspicious!”</p>

<p>“We’ll have to give the boy time to explain
everything,” Clay admonished. “I have great faith in
him.”</p>

<p>“How long do you think that kid, Jule, will remain in there?” Alex yawned.</p>

<p>“Not long, I hope.”</p>

<p>It had been the original intention to enter the
jungle as far as the boat light could be seen, but
now the necessity of remaining where they were, or
close to the shore, was apparent, as they had no
means of knowing in which direction either of
the boys had gone, and there were three wanderers
to watch for instead of only two. If they
followed in the direction supposed to have been taken
by Frank and Case, they would be apt to get
farther and farther from Jule, and if they tried
to follow the latter, it would be the two who
would be farthest from their help, should help be
required.</p>

<p>The only course to pursue, then, with reference to
boys who were in the dark forest, was to remain
where they were, guard the boat, and be prepared
to get back to the <i>Rambler</i> in quick time should
necessity demand such action.</p>

<p>The boys waited with premonitions of approaching
evil in their minds. Now and then Captain Joe,
disgusted with the conduct of his master, sent out
a call for sympathy and liberty, and the voice of
the dog sounded cheerful and friendly to the anxious lads.</p>

<p>Small creatures of air and thicket were talking
all around them, and now and then a gruffer utterance
in the distance told of larger denizens of
the forest aroused by the visit of the boys. After
a time a crunching in the undergrowth warned the
listeners that some creature of large size was
approaching them on a visit of inspection.</p>

<p>“It may be an Indian!” Alex whispered, when
the sounds were very close indeed.</p>

<p>“An Indian wouldn’t advance in the midst of a
racket like that,” Clay reasoned. “It is probably
some wild animal coming up to see what all this
row is about. Keep your automatic and your flashlight ready.”</p>

<p>Alex did not need any such warning, for he stood
with the automatic in one hand and the dark
flashlight in the other.</p>

<p>The trampling came on, closer and closer, and
the boys involuntarily drew nearer together. They
could hear shrubs cracking and breaking under the
heavy tread of their approaching visitor.</p>

<p>“It must be a jaguar!” whispered Alex. “Shall
I turn on my light before he gets up to us?”</p>

<p>“More likely a peccary, or wild hog,” Clay
suggested. “They are dangerous only when attacked.”</p>

<p>Snorts and grunts coming from the thicket soon
proved the correctness of this supposition, and then
the peccary turned back, much to the relief of the
boys and the disgust of Captain Joe, who had from
the cabin scented a possible enemy and a chance at
pursuit.</p>

<p>Then another and much more surprising and
disquieting sound came from the forest. This was
nothing less than the gruff voices of two men,
speaking in English. The boys listened in wonder
and dismay. Who could these people be? Why
were they there in that lonely spot? Were their
intentions friendly or hostile? These questions were
soon answered, and in a most unsatisfactory manner.</p>

<p>“The Indian will take care of the two kids, all
right,” they heard a coarse voice say, “and we’ll get
into the boat before the others wake up.”</p>

<p>“Lucky to find a boat here—and a motor boat at
that,” another voice said. “It won’t take us long
to get to the headwaters now.”</p>

<p>The boys stood perfectly still, listening to the
throaty chuckles which followed this last remark.
And so the new comers were enemies, and had designs
on the boat! More than that, their conversation
indicated that two of the boys, probably Case
and Frank, had been discovered by the marauders
and left in the custody of a native! The situation
was serious, especially as the prow light disclosed
the deserted condition of the <i>Rambler</i>.</p>

<p>One of the men moved out to the shore, so that
a burly figure was outlined against the light on the
prow of the boat. The lads moved forward a pace,
in order to inspect the intruder at closer range, and
a snapping twig betrayed their presence.</p>

<p>“Stay where you are!” a rough voice called
back to them, “and we’ll just take charge of this
boat!”</p>

<p>“Step into that light,” Clay answered, “and
you’ll take charge of a bullet!”</p>
 </div>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chXIII'>CHAPTER XIII.—A PLEASANT SURPRISE</h2>

<p class='first'>Little dreaming of the desperate situation at the
boat, yet understanding that the Englishmen had set
out to take possession of her, Case and Frank stood
silently, watchfully, at the campfire while the thing
the Indian had fled from stepped out of the
darkness and approached them.</p>

<p>Two conflicting emotions held them motionless,
speechless. One was of joy at the flight of their
guard, the other was something akin to the terror
which had sent Ugly into the bush at headlong
speed.</p>

<p>The noise of the Indian’s progress through the
forest might still be heard as trailing vines tore at
his garments and sent him floundering to the ground
only to leap to his feet and dash recklessly on once
more. The thing advancing upon them was silent,
the crouching figure moving over the ground like an
ape, the features obliterated as to outline by a veil
of yellow flame from which misty emanations proceeded.</p>

<p>Case was not at all superstitious. He saw in the
queer figure only a trick of some enemy, and so
sprang for the automatic rifle which the Indian had
cast away in his flight. The next moment it was
leveled at the advancing figure. The result was as
remarkable as it was instantaneous.</p>

<p>The figure dropped to the ground, rolling about,
kicking spasmodically at the empty air, and emitting
shouts of laughter which rang oddly through the
forest. Case understood and darted forward,
shouting that it was Jule, up to another of his tricks!</p>

<p>“Whoo—pee!” yelled Jule, rolling about in an
abandonment of mirth.</p>

<p>“I’ll show you!” Case cried, taking the boy
by the back of the neck. “I’ll show you what we do
to spooks in Brazil!”</p>

<p>Frank stood as if still unconvinced.</p>

<p>“Quit!” Jule remonstrated, as Case lifted him
to his feet. “You let me go! Don’t you know any
more than to take a fellow by the hair of his head.
“Quit, I tell you!”</p>

<p>Case released the boy, whose face and hands
were still shining with the sulphur which he had
rubbed from old-fashioned matches, and pushed him
away as he arose to his feet.</p>

<p>“You smell like a match factory!” he said.</p>

<p>Jule leaned against the bole of the tree and
laughed until the woods rang again, while Frank
stood looking on with wonder in his eyes.</p>

<p>“I thought he was the Old Scratch!” the boy
commented, in a moment. “Where did he get that
fire paint?”</p>

<p>“Rubbed it off from matches,” answered Case.
“It makes a great show in the dark. No wonder
Ugly took to his heels!”</p>

<p>“Who is your horned friend?” asked Jule,
nodding his head in the direction the Indian had taken.
“He is some runner!”</p>

<p>Then Jule glanced about at the fire, at the
unfamiliar automatic gun in Case’s hands, and at a
collection of simple cooking implements which lay
to one side, and asked:</p>

<p>“Where did all this come from, and what are you
boys doing here? Where’s the cargo?” then,
breaking in upon each other, as if that would hasten the
relation of the strange story they had to tell, each
one giving an entirely different version of the
incident, the boys informed Jule of what had taken
place. Case described the Englishmen as bushmen,
similar to the natives who prowl the forests of
Australia, while Frank insisted that they were
educated men gone back to primitive life because of
degenerate dispositions or because of fear of
punishment for crimes committed.</p>

<p>“It looks to me, then,” Jule commented, looking
suspiciously about, “that I came up in good time,
and that my desire to give you a good scare brought
you out of a bad situation. Oh, my!” he added,
throwing back his head, “how that Indian did take
to the woods! I don’t believe he will stop this side
of the Arctic circle. He certainly can go some!”</p>

<p>“He probably has gone to warn the others,”
Case suggested.</p>

<p>“That is exactly where he has gone!” cried Jule,
“and we’d better be getting back. If we keep right
along behind him, we’ll have the brutes between two
fires.”</p>

<p>“How did you manage to get away from Clay?”
asked Case. “He didn’t want you to leave the
boat.”</p>

<p>“Why, when we all came ashore to see why you
boys did not come back, I just naturally sneaked
away.”</p>

<p>“You all came ashore!” echoed Case. “Do you
mean to say that there is no one in the boat? No
one on board at all?”</p>

<p>“There wasn’t when I came away!” admitted
Jule, sheepishly.</p>

<p>“That’s a nice thing, too!” cried Case, reprovingly.</p>

<p>Without waiting to further discuss the situation,
anxious only for the safety of their friends and the
boat, the three made their way through the black
jungle at reckless speed. The night had cleared a
trifle, and now and then a glance upward, through
the jealous foliage of the trees and creepers, revealed
a star looking down into the aisles of the wood.</p>

<p>Now and then they came to a little glade clearer
of undergrowth than the general run of the jungle
through which they were struggling, and at such
time, with only the complaints of the creatures of
the forest about them, they halted and listened.
Presently, during such a halt, they heard a shot, and
then the sharp, snappy, full-throated barking of a
dog.</p>

<p>“Captain Joe!” Jule cried.</p>

<p>“He’s on the boat?” asked Frank.</p>

<p>“Sure he is, unless he’s found the key and unlocked
the cabin door,” replied Jule, with a grin.</p>

<p>“If they get hold of Captain Joe,” Case observed,
not without a grin of satisfaction, “they’ll know
they’ve come to a scrapper.”</p>

<p>“He’ll climb on their roofs and claw their shingles
off!” exclaimed Jule.</p>

<p>“I won’t have to wash dishes in a month!”
crowed Case. “That is the slangiest slang I ever
heard!”</p>

<p>“I don’t care,” Jule answered as he swung a
hanging creeper out of his eyes. “That is just
what Captain Joe will do if he gets a chance. But
you needn’t go and tell Clay that I said it, all the
same!” he added, with visions of many dishes to
wash before his eyes.</p>

<p>Another shot came as the boys started away, and
Case declared that it undoubtedly came from an
automatic revolver, and proved that the boys were
putting up a fight.</p>

<p>“Captain Joe told us that,” Jule insisted.</p>

<p>Several other shots were fired before the boys
came to the bank of Ruination creek. It was still
dark, although a star reflected in the water at rare
intervals. Still, the outlines of the trees could be
faintly seen across the creek, and the prow light
burning on the <i>Rambler</i> cast a white radiance
farther down stream.</p>

<p>The three crept out to the margin of the creek and
peered over a low, bush-crowned headland toward
the boat. From where they stood the forward deck
was in plain sight. At the back an overhanging
tree made a black blot about the stern. There was
no one to be seen.</p>

<p>Another shot came from farther down, and the
barking of the dog became fierce and incessant.</p>

<p>“Captain Joe will be eating up that cabin next,”
Jule volunteered. “I wish I could tell him what to
say!”</p>

<p>“Why don’t they go into the cabin and let him
out?” asked Frank.</p>

<p>“Because neither side can get into the boat,”
replied Case, grasping the situation at once.
“Anyone showing himself under that prow light would
be shot to death in a second. The only way the
ruffians can get to the <i>Rambler</i> is to shoot out the
light.”</p>

<p>“Then how are we ever to get on board?” asked Frank.</p>

<p>“Drive the outlaws away!” replied Case.</p>

<p>“Sure!” Jule put in, thoughtfully, “and I’ve
found a way to do it. You just watch me.”</p>

<p>The two boys watched Jule with both wonder and
amusement in their eyes as he drew out a great
bunch of old-fashioned sulphur matches and began
rolling them between the palms of his hands. Very
little came from his efforts, and Case began poking
fun at him.</p>

<p>“Doesn’t work like it did when you scared the
wits out of the Indian, does it?” he demanded. “I
reckon we ran so fast through the thickets that we
left the sulphur stuff behind, leaving only the dry
sticks in your pocket!”</p>

<p>“Never you mind,” Jule answered, “you just
wait until I get ready, then I’ll show you something
worth while.”</p>

<p>“That’s what Frank said about his cargo!” cried
Case, apparently determined to find whatever humor
there was in the situation. “Where is that cargo
now, kid?” he added, turning toward Frank and
giving him a pull by the arm. “Do you think that
Indian carried it off with him?”</p>

<p>“I’m going after the cargo before daylight,” the
lad replied, stubbornly.</p>

<p>“Yes you are!” Jule broke in. “We’re going to
get as far away from Ruination creek as we can
before sunrise! You see what Clay says about your
going into that mess again! Why, kid, those men
you saw—the friends of yours who are trying to
get the boat now!—will hang around here for a
month if we don’t go away—just on the chance of
getting the <i>Rambler</i>.”</p>

<p>“I’m going after that cargo again,” repeated
Frank, “and I’m going to get it—if those
Englishmen haven’t carried it off. Friends of mine, you
call ’em! Well, I guess not!”</p>

<p>“How many will it take to carry the cargo out
to the boat,” asked Case, giving Jule a sly dig in the
ribs, “if we get it away from your friends?”</p>

<p>Frank laughed at the attempt to provoke him,
but made no reply, and in a moment Jule resumed
his work with the sulphur matches. This playing
“spook” with matches was an old trick of the boy’s,
and he had brought these old-fashioned ones along
on the chance of finding them useful. He was more
than satisfied with the result of his first tryout with
them, and chuckled as he thought of the fright of
Ugly, and also of the assistance he had been able
by their aid to render his friends.</p>

<p>Only for his childish prank, he reflected, Case and
Frank would still be in the custody of the Indian,
and Clay and Alex would be facing the renegades
alone.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do when you get through
that monkey work?” asked Case, presently, as Jule
continued to roll matches in his hands.</p>

<p>“I’m going on board the <i>Rambler</i>,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“I’m going to let Captain Joe out, and tell him what
to do to the men in the bush.”</p>

<p>Case glanced again at the lighted prow of the
boat and at the wide space one attempting to reach
the deck would have to cross under rifle fire.</p>

<p>“You never can do it!” he declared.</p>

<p>“See that tree back there, at the stem of the
boat?” asked Jule, in a whisper. “Well, I’m going
to swim under water until I get to the black spot
under that tree, where the light is shut out by the
foliage and the cabin, and then I’m going to climb
up on the back platform of the boat and through the
window to the interior of the cabin. Any objections,
Sober Sides?”</p>

<p>“You can’t do it,” Frank Whispered. “You are
not well yet. Suppose you let me try?”</p>

<p>“Not in a hundred years!” chuckled Jule. “I
guess you don’t know I’m the champion under-water
swimmer of Chicago! I’ll be inside the boat in no
time, and then there will be doings. I’ll show my
devil face to the bushmen and let the dog out, and
there won’t be anything to it. Perhaps I’d better
make a devil dog out of Captain Joe!”</p>

<p>“Try it, and he’ll eat you up!” cried Case.
“Don’t be foolish.”</p>

<p>“The sulphur will wash off,” warned Frank.</p>

<p>“Water will only make it all the brighter,”
insisted Jule. “Now watch me go to it! When I
get in, you boys come. Will you? All right! Now
here goes for a swim! Be sure and keep well under
water when you come!”</p>

<p>There was a slight splash in the creek, and Jule
was out of sight.</p>
 </div>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chXIV'>CHAPTER XIV.—A BATTLE FOR THE BOAT</h2>

<p class='first'>Case had expressed the situation exactly in
answering Frank’s question as to why the boys did
not go into the cabin and release Captain Joe. The
prow light cast a circle of illumination over the
forward deck and also over the water between the prow
and the shore.</p>

<p>Anyone stepping into that circle would simply be
a mark for the bullets of his enemies. The only
way in which the boat could be safely entered, with
the bushmen and the boys watching each other,
would be to shoot out the light and make a rush
for it.</p>

<p>This Clay did not care to do, for he had hope that
the boys back in the forest might in time come to
his assistance. He had understood from the few
words spoken in his hearing by the intruders that
Case and Frank had been attacked by the fellows,
but he did not know the exact situation, of course.
And even if Case and Frank were in as great need
of help as he himself was, there was still
Jule—resourceful, courageous, and quite likely to turn
up in the most unexpected place at the right time.</p>

<p>The Englishmen, also, hoped to take the boat
without destroying the prow light, for they knew
very well that they would have need of it in the
hasty journey they had planned to start out on the
minute they gained possession of the <i>Rambler</i>. The
outcome of all this was that the two parties remained
hidden in the forest, each watching the other, and
each hoping that the other would make a rush for
the deck of the boat.</p>

<p>This was the situation when Jule plunged into the
creek and, under water, in a slow current, struck
out for the rear of the boat, protected by the boughs
of the tree and the bulk of the cabin from the rays
of the light on the prow. The last thing he heard as
he leaped into the warm waters of Ruination creek
were the words of Case and Frank promising to
follow him by the under-water route to the cabin and
the noisy expostulations of Captain Joe at being kept
out of the fight!</p>

<p>“The dog will be frantic when he hears me
opening the window,” thought the lad, as he turned on
his back and came up for a mouthful of air. “I hope
he won’t advertise the fact that I’ve come aboard.”</p>

<p>So, while Frank and Case were waiting in the
keenest anxiety at the point from which Jule had
entered the water, while Clay and Alex were in the
bushes not far away, watching with all the eyes in
their heads for a shot at their enemies, and while the
two Englishmen were trying to mature some plan
for getting into the boat without running the risk of
passing under the light, Jule made his way along
the bottom of the creek, rising to breathe only at
rare intervals, and finally came up, without being
discovered, at the rear of the boat.</p>

<p>The rear deck, or platform, for it was little more,
was entirely out of sight and range of the fighters
in the forest on the bank the boy had just left, so he
climbed up on it with confidence. But a new peril
awaited him. Captain Joe set up such a volley of
barks, and growls, and scratchings that it seemed
to the boy that those on shore must understand that
something unusual was going on in the boat and
make a rush for it. The dog was certainly doing his
duty, so far as noise went, in guarding the <i>Rambler</i>!</p>

<p>“Captain Joe!” called Jule.</p>

<p>The dog let out a fiercer challenge than before.</p>

<p>“Captain Joe!” repeated the lad. “If you don’t
quit that I’ll come in there and crack your crust!”</p>

<p>Jule checked himself and broke into a chuckle.
He had been much given to the use of slang in the
old days, and it still seemed to come involuntarily to
his lips, so did more than his share of the
dish-washing as a result. There was never anything profane
or coarse about his lapses into the dialect of the
street, but by common consent all slang had been
barred. Now he was glad that Clay was not near
to hear this new outburst.</p>

<p>The dog began sniffing at the window on the inside.
He would have recognized Jule, doubtless, in
a moment only for the odor of sulphur with which
his clothes, even though they were wet, was permeated.</p>

<p>“Lie down, dog!” Jule whispered.</p>

<p>Then Captain Joe recognized the voice and gave
forth a low whine of recognition and
reproach—recognition in spite of the sulphur, and reproach
because of his having been left there alone while the
others took an outing in the forest!</p>

<p>Jule finally managed to unfasten the window and
crawl into the cabin. Captain Joe gave him an
appropriate reception, and then sat down to look from
the boy to the door, and back and forth, until his
eyes and the motions of his head seemed to say:</p>

<p>“Well, why don’t you hurry up and let me out?”</p>

<p>“All right, old chap!” Jule answered the look.
“I’ll let you out just as soon as it is safe for you
to go.”</p>

<p>Captain Joe insisted that he wanted to go at once,
in order that he might see what was going on
outside, but Jule consoled him with a caress and stood
waiting for Case and Frank to make their appearance.
Before long a commotion in the water back
of the boat told of the approach of someone.</p>

<p>Jule crept back to the platform and waited,
thinking that Frank might need assistance in getting
out of the water. When he turned to look back he
saw that Captain Joe had followed him to the window
and was now trying his best to follow his
example and get through. However, he seemed to
have stuck in the narrow opening, not knowing how
to bring his hind legs up to the sill.</p>

<p>The dog whined a warning and Jule turned back
to the dark pool of river at the stern. A head lifted
darkly from the surface and a face masked by
heavy whiskers and seen only in outline regarded
the boy blankly. The attacking party, it seemed,
had adopted the same tactics to get into the boat as
had the boy.</p>

<p>“Come off there!” commanded the gruff voice of
the fellow, as he took hold of the boat “Come off
or I’ll be the death of you!”</p>

<p>“What do you want here?” demanded Jule.</p>

<p>The intruder made no reply, but exerted himself
climbing to the platform, from which he could have
taken possession of the boat in spite of the efforts of
the boy, who was unarmed, having left his
automatic and searchlight with Case on shore.</p>

<p>He looked about for some weapon with which to
repel the boarder, but the platform was clear. Then
he sprang to the window, hoping to get through it
and barricade himself in the cabin.</p>

<p>But he found Captain Joe stuck in the opening!
The dog was doing his best to wiggle out, his eyes
flaming fiercely, his snarling jaws showing two rows
of capable teeth, as he eyed with disfavor the faint
figure of the man who was already climbing on the
boat. It was a desperate situation, but at the same
time it had its humorous features, as Captain Joe
certainly was in a comical plight, half in and half
out of the window.</p>

<p>“Get him, Joe!”</p>

<p>Jule urged the dog on by pointing as he spoke.
Captain Joe licked his chops, as if anxious to
sample the intruder, but he was stuck fast, and the
boarder was now half out of the water.</p>

<p>“Get him, Joe! Get him!”</p>

<p>The boy gave a yank at the dog’s head as he gave
the command, and then something happened. The
dog slipped out of the window opening, passed
through Jule’s arms like a white flash of light and
launched himself on the man who was almost on
the platform.</p>

<p>The two, the dog and the bearded man, went over
the rear together with a great splash, and directly
two heads were dimly seen on the surface. Captain
Joe had caught the Englishman by the shoulder, and
a stain of red dropped from his jaws before his head
disappeared from sight again.</p>

<p>The boy did not want to see the dog kill the man,
and he shouted to Captain Joe, entreating,
commanding, coaxing, but the water was deep and the
unequal combat was going on beyond the reach of
words.</p>

<p>While Jule waited for the fighters to come to the
surface again, hoping that he might be able to do
something toward releasing the man, Alex came
bobbing around the corner of the boat. At the first
sound of Jule’s voice on the boat he had leaped into
the water and made for the stern platform. This
interruption saved the man’s life, for Captain Joe,
coming to the surface, recognized his master and,
releasing his hold, swam toward him.</p>

<p>Though half drowned and seriously injured by
the teeth of the dog, the intruder managed to make
his way to the dark shore. When, a moment later,
the boys looked for him he had disappeared in the
thicket. Jule had blazed the way to the boat, and
in a short time all the boys were on the stern deck
or in the cabin.</p>

<p>There was no indication of a fresh attack from
the shore, and when a single shot was fired, some
distance away, the boys took that for a signal from
one ruffian to his mate. One was now on the north
side of Ruination creek and the other on the south
side, and it would be some time before they could
plan any more mischief together.</p>

<p>Clay looked at Jule’s face as he climbed to the
platform and burst into a laugh. There was a good
showing of phosphorus still in sight.</p>

<p>“Where did you get it?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No wonder that man hustled off into the
woods!” Alex added.</p>

<p>“That didn’t frighten him a bit!” Jule explained.
“He seemed to be wise to the trick. Anyway he
would have been in charge here now if Captain Joe
hadn’t risen to the occasion. Good old Captain
Joe!” he continued, patting the dog on the head.</p>

<p>“We’d better be moving,” Clay said, presently,
after Case and Frank had briefly explained the
events of the night in the forest. “Those men will
hang around us as long as we remain here.”</p>

<p>“But Frank wants to get his cargo!” Jule
laughed.</p>

<p>“Indeed I do,” put in the boy.</p>

<p>“It seems to me,” Case suggested, “that Frank
has already secured his cargo—a cargo of experience!”</p>

<p>“We can’t exchange experience for money!”
Jule declared, “not always!”</p>

<p>“I’ve jut got to get that cargo,” Frank insisted.
“It is too dark to attempt to move out of this
narrow creek anyway,” he urged, “and so we may as
well remain here until morning.”</p>

<p>“That won’t be very long,” Clay said, “for there
is a faint smudge of daylight in the east.”</p>

<p>“If it is most morning,” Alex cried, “that
accounts for the empty condition of my stomach. I’m
going to get something to eat!”</p>

<p>“That suits me,” Jule grinned, and Case and Clay
were not slow in agreeing to the proposition.</p>

<p>Frank seemed lost in thought. He said nothing
regarding supper, or breakfast, rather, and sat
quietly near the door of the cabin while the boys,
now apparently safe from attack, fried bacon and
made pancakes and coffee. When the bacon,
pancakes and coffee were steaming on the table, Clay
turned to the forward deck and called to the boy.
But Frank was not there.</p>

<p>It was now quite light in the eastern sky, though
the forest still showed dark and dreary. Clay went
to the side of the boat and looked down to the place
where he had tied the row-boat, which had been
brought out soon after the disappearance of the
man who had been attacked by the dog. The boat
was nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p>“Frank has gone!” Clay shouted.</p>

<p>“He’s determined to have that cargo!” Alex
explained. “It is a risky thing to do, this going
into the jungle alone, but I can’t say as I blame
him!”</p>

<p>The boys did not enjoy their early meal very
much, for they were anxious over Frank’s
disappearance. They knew well enough where he had
gone. The cargo he insisted on securing must be
somewhere near the scene of the night’s adventures
in the jungle, and he had gone there—alone!</p>
 </div>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chXV'>CHAPTER XV.—THE VANISHING “CARGO”</h2>

<p class='first'>The sun rose red and hot, looking like the bottom
of a newly-scoured brass bowl. It was insufferably
warm, and there was no breeze. Alex got out a
spyglass and went to the prow.</p>

<p>“What are you looking for?” asked Case. “Expect
to see Frank through a mile of trees?”</p>

<p>“No,” grinned Alex. “I’m looking for the
equator! It is so hot here that it seems to me as if
it must have sagged down toward the creek.”</p>

<p>“That’s a very bad joke!” laughed Case.</p>

<p>In a moment Alex turned his glass toward the
shore, scanning the jungle into which they had
penetrated the night before. Presently his eyes
brightened and he handed the glass to Clay with a
whoop of joy.</p>

<p>“There’s Frank!” he shouted. “Coming on a
run—or as near to a run as a thousand creeping
vines tangled around his legs will admit of. And I
don’t see him carrying any cargo. Seems to be
running in ballast!”</p>

<p>“See anyone chasing him?” asked Jule of Clay,
who was now looking anxiously through the glass.</p>

<p>“Not a soul,” replied Clay. “He is at the
row-boat now, and is putting off for the <i>Rambler</i>.”</p>

<p>“Guess it doesn’t require any spyglass to see
that!” Jule broke in. “Hello, there, kid!” he
shouted, leaning over the railing, “where have you
been? You’ve missed a square meal.”</p>

<p>Frank rowed out to the motor boat and climbed
wearily to the deck before attempting any reply.
Then he handed a closely-tied oblong packet to Clay
and dropped into a convenient chair.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” demanded the boys in a chorus.
“The cargo!” smiled Frank.</p>

<p>Clay hastily untied the strings which secured the
paper wrapping of the packet, disclosing a canvas
bag, which gave forth a pleasant, tinkling sound as
the boy bounced it up and down in his hand.</p>

<p>“What’s in it?” asked Jule. “Sounds like
something you can turn into gasoline, all right.”</p>

<p>Frank replied with a motion for Clay to open
the bag. He did so, and a roll of gold coins was
exposed to view. Amazement, incredulity, joy, all
showed on the faces of the boys, who now gathered
closer about Clay and began fingering the coins, of
which there were about two score.</p>

<p>“It is the real stuff!” Alex decided, turning his
head critically.</p>

<p>“American twenty-dollar pieces!” gasped Case.</p>

<p>“Where in the name of all the seven seas did you
get it?” asked Clay.</p>

<p>But the lads did not wait for Frank to reply.
They seized him by the arms, the neck, the legs, and
hustled him about, thumping him with their fists in
the way boys have of expressing great appreciation.
Even Captain Joe came out of the cabin and joined
in the celebration.</p>

<p>“You just wait!” Alex shouted, when the excitement
had in a measure died out—that is, when
Frank was permitted to stand on his own feet
again—“just you wait until I feed you up proper for this!
There’s a tin of roast beef left that we’ve been saving
for a joy-feast, and that is what you’re going to
get for breakfast! And fish! And wild fowl! And
dessert! And there’s a can of honey, and some
sixty-cent coffee we’ve been hoarding! You just wait and
I’ll show you a feed that will make your eyes stick
out!”</p>

<p>Alex at once set about celebrating the receipt of
the wonderful “cargo” by getting Frank such a
breakfast as had not been seen on the <i>Rambler</i>
since she had turned her nose out of the Mississippi.
This characteristic expression of approval was
seconded by the others, and all Frank’s efforts to
induce the others to share his meal were ignored.
Captain Joe deigned to accept a bit of the roast
beef, but he did it as one conferring a great favor.</p>

<p>“Now, where did you get it?” asked Clay, when
Frank drew back from the little cabin table and
sought the cooler air under the awning which ran
over the forward deck. “Did you know all the time
that you could find it here? Then why didn’t you
tell us?”</p>

<p>“Did you see anything of Ugly in there?” asked
Case, his mind going back to the dark hours in the
jungle.</p>

<p>“Ugly!” Jule exclaimed. “Why, that Indian is
running yet.”</p>

<p>“Or the Englishmen?” persisted Case.</p>

<p>“We went in the wrong direction last night,”
Frank replied, dodging the questions. “This morning,
when it began to get daylight, I saw right
where my tree hotel was, and went to it without
difficulty.”</p>

<p>“You never found that in a tree!” Jule objected.</p>

<p>“Yes, I did,” answered Frank. “I found it in a
tree because I put it in a tree on the way down.
That is one reason why I wanted to get back in a
motor boat. We could stop here without attracting
attention and get the money.”</p>

<p>“But we did attract attention! And you said—you
said you found the cargo here, in a tree, when
you were on your way down the river!” insisted
Alex.</p>

<p>“I did find it in a tree, but only after I had hidden
it there,” Frank explained. “You see, as I have
already told you, I was pursued on the way out, and,
thinking I might be caught and searched—as I
was—I hid the money in a tree—the money and, other
things I valued more than the money. Then, after
my pursuers went away, I went back to the tree and
took out some of the money, and something else,
and made my way out of the country.”</p>

<p>“What was this something else?” asked Alex,
always curious to know everything connected with
the boy’s past life.</p>

<p>“I shall have to tell you about that some other
time,” laughed Frank. “Just now, I think, we’d
better be getting out into the Amazon again, for we
still have a long way to go before we sight Cloud
island.”</p>

<p>“There’s that Cloud island again!” cried Jule.
“I’d like to know what you mean by keeping the
secret of it from us.”</p>

<p>“You’ll have to wait!” was all Frank would say.</p>

<p>Early in the forenoon the <i>Rambler</i> was headed
for the Madeira, and then, much to the surprise of
the others, Frank turned the prow down the stream
toward the Amazon.</p>

<p>“What about this little town up the river where
you were going to dispose of your cargo?” demanded Alex.</p>

<p>“You refer to Rosarinho?” asked the boy.</p>

<p>“Don’t know the name,” Alex answered, “except
that it sounds to me like rhino—which means
hard cash in some localities in Chicago.”</p>

<p>“That is a good town to visit for the purchase of
supplies,” Frank said, “but I have an idea that the
Englishmen we have been having trouble with will
go there, so we’ll give them the slip and buy our
supplies at Monteiro, which is on the right bank of
the Madeira, near the junction with the Amazon.
It is not wise to hunt trouble by following those
men.”</p>

<p>“What did they want in that jungle?” asked Jule.
“They were stranded,” answered Case, who had
heard the story told Frank by the Indian. “They
wanted our boat—that’s all.”</p>

<p>Then Case turned and whispered to Frank:</p>

<p>“Ever see those men before? I thought one of
them seemed to have a mutual understanding with
you about—well, about Cloud island, you know.
What is all this talk about Cloud island?”</p>

<p>“As I have told you boys before, I can’t tell you
anything now. I may tell you all about it in time,
but just now there is nothing to say.”</p>

<p>“But about those men?” persisted Case.</p>

<p>“I don’t remember either face,” Frank replied,
slowly, “but I have an idea that they knew me—that
is, that they have heard of me, somewhere,
before we met in the jungle. If they are going to
Cloud island, as they told the Indian, they certainly
knew something about my affairs before they
started. Now, that is all I’m going to tell you
about it,” he added with a smile.</p>

<p>Arrived at Monteiro, Clay brought out the
company purse and showed that it was empty.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to borrow from Frank,” he said.
“I was in hope that we could get a real cargo
somewhere, and so get through on our own resources,
but it seems that we’ve either got to go back,
drifting down, or run in debt.”</p>

<p>“Why,” Frank said, astonished, “this money
belongs to the common fund—it is just as much
yours as it is mine.”</p>

<p>“I fail to see it in that light,” Clay insisted.
“The money belongs to you individually, and if
we use any portion of it we’ll pay it back.”</p>

<p>“And here I’ve been riding with you, and living
off you, for weeks,” urged Frank. “If you took all
this money you wouldn’t have any too much pay for
what you’ve done for me. If you don’t take it, I’ll
get off at Monteiro and wait for a steamer going up
the river.”</p>

<p>“If you try that,” Alex declared, “I’ll set the dog
on you.”</p>

<p>“Aw, give the money to me!” Jule cut in. “I’ll
borrow it and contribute it as my share of the
expense. Anytime a boy wants to give away money,
I’ll accommodate him!”</p>

<p>“We’ll give a note for it,” suggested Case, and
so the boys counted out the gold pieces—there were
forty of the denomination of $20—and gave a joint
note for $800. Jule laughed as he put his name to
the paper in letters an inch long.</p>

<p>“I’ll make ’em good and big,” he explained,
“because the name is all there is to it, the names, I
mean. We are all infants in the eyes of the law,
you know.”</p>

<p>“Where did you learn that term?” asked Alex.
“You must have been studying law.”</p>

<p>“Dr. Holcomb says I’m an infant in the eyes of
the law, anyway!” the boy replied. “Now, if
you’ve got this money matter settled, suppose we go
ashore and feed up. I’m hungry for something that
hasn’t been lugged about in tin cans for a month.”</p>

<p>“Rich we are!” shouted Alex, “and we’ll have
a feed on shore that will put an inch of fat on our
ribs! Hurry up, fellows!”</p>

<p>“Someone must remain on the boat,” suggested
Frank, and I’ll be the guard. I can go ashore after
you all get back.”</p>

<p>“You furnish the money and stay out of the
feast!” cried Jule. “Not if I know it. I’ll remain
on the boat, and you can bring me a modest meal
in a bushel basket. You’ll need Frank as
interpreter, anyway.”</p>

<p>It was finally arranged that Jule should remain
on board, and the others soon set off in the little
boat. They reached the town in a few moments,
wandered about the illy-kept streets for a time, and
then hunted up a place where motor boat supplies
were sold. The order for gasoline and provisions
was given, Clay promising to pay when the goods
were delivered on board the <i>Rambler</i>.</p>

<p>“These people may be all right,” Clay explained
to the others, “but it is just as well to pay on
delivery.”</p>

<p>Finally they came to a public restaurant which
seemed to be tolerably clean. It was a small public
eating house, such as one finds at Havana and Para,
operated in Spanish style and boasting a fair menu.
The boys found that they could get steaks there
and ordered liberally. An extra one was ordered
cooked for Jule.</p>

<p>The lads enjoyed their dinners greatly, Alex
declaring that the only thing lacking to make it
perfect was the motion of a boat on a stream! The
cooking was good and the attendance perfect, but
there was something about the seeming friendliness
of the proprietor, who insisted on personally
attending to the wants of the boys, which was not
wholly sincere—at least so it seemed to Case.</p>

<p>When he referred to the matter, however, the
others laughed at him, and Clay even showed a
handful of gold when he paid for the dinners and the
basket which was going back to Jule, well loaded
with eatables. After leaving the place Clay turned
back.</p>

<p>“I’m going to have some of that odd-tasting
coffee put into the basket for Jule,” he said. “I meant
to have it done while we were in there. I’ll go back
and have it put in, and you boys go on around the
town and meet me there.”</p>

<p>The others protested against Clay going back
alone, but he only laughed at their fears. Half an
hour later, after walking through the main streets of
the odd Brazilian city, the boys entered the restaurant
to find Clay sitting at the table they had occupied
with his head on an arm, which was resting on the
table. He seemed to be sound asleep, and Case and
Alex shook him vigorously.</p>

<p>“He has been asleep for a long time,” the
proprietor explained, in Spanish, translated by Frank,
“and I let him alone. He had company with him at
the table first, and they ordered coffee—coffee to
drink and more coffee to put in the basket.”</p>

<p>The boys lifted Clay to his feet and shook him
until he opened his eyes. He seemed to be dazed,
and Frank set the boy back into a chair and gave
his attention to his pockets. They were all turned
wrong side out and empty!</p>

<p>The proprietor insisted on calling in the police.
He declared that one of the men Clay had visited
with at the table was not above suspicion, and began
to talk vaguely about getting the money back.</p>

<p>“Wait,” Frank said to him. “We’ll go on board
with him first. You see,” he continued, talking to
the boys after they had finally succeeded in getting
Clay out of the place, apparently against the wishes
of the owner, “if he calls in the police we’ll be held
no one knows how long as witnesses. One of us
may even be accused of taking the money. They
are all against foreigners here, so the best thing for
us to do is to pocket the loss and get away as soon
as possible.”</p>

<p>This was agreed to, with many sighs at the loss of
the money, and the boys were soon on board the
<i>Rambler</i>, where they found Jule arguing fiercely
with a man who did not know what Jule was saying
any more than Jule knew what he was saying.
Frank listened and turned a pale face to Clay.</p>

<p>“We’re tied up,” he said, “until the stores are
paid for!”</p>
 </div>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chXVI'>CHAPTER XVI.—“KEEP HER HEAD ON!”</h2>

<p class='first'>“Tied up!” repeated Alex. “Does that mean
that we can’t give ’em back their stuff and take the
<i>Rambler</i> away?”</p>

<p>“I’ll find out,” Frank volunteered, turning to the
Spaniard who was now shaking his fists’ angrily in
the air and almost foaming at the mouth.</p>

<p>There was a short conference, and then Frank
turned back to the boys, his manner not at all
encouraging.</p>

<p>“He wants his pay, or the boat!” he said. “He
says he’s been to all the trouble of getting the goods
on board, and that he’s not going to go to the
further bother of taking them off. He says we can’t
leave this harbor until we settle in full.”</p>

<p>“But he can’t hold the boat,” urged Case. “It
doesn’t belong to us, but to Dr. Holcomb.”</p>

<p>Again Frank conferred with the excited dealer
in marine supplies.</p>

<p>“He says that in law that makes no difference,”
was the discouraging report.</p>

<p>“He got here pretty quickly after the robbery,”
Case suggested. “Ask him if he knows that Clay
was drugged and robbed,” he added.</p>

<p>Frank talked with the merchant again, and he
answered that he had heard something about it, but
thought it all a Yankee trick. During this
conversation Clay had not opened his mouth to speak.
He stood leaning against the cabin door frame, his
hands in his pockets, his eyes on the deck. Now he
turned and entered the cabin, closing the door behind
him. Case followed him with his eyes until the door
closed, then spoke to Alex.</p>

<p>“Go in there and see what he’s up to,” he said.
“He is taking this too hard. Tell him we don’t
blame him a bit—that it would have been the same
if either one of us had had the money. Tell him to
buck up!”</p>

<p>Alex rushed into the cabin and Case gave his
attention to the Spanish merchant, who was now
gesticulating and calling to three men who were
putting off in a row-boat.</p>

<p>“He means to have the <i>Rambler</i>,” Frank said,
dejectedly. “Those men are officers. Once they
get their feet on this deck it will be impossible to
continue on our way.”</p>

<p>Jule heard and turned toward the motors. In a
moment sharp explosions which denoted full speed
were heard, and the boat began backing out into the
river. The men in the row-boat shouted and waved
weapons in the air, but did not fire. The Spanish
merchant fairly danced up and down in frantic rage,
declaring that the boys would all go to jail for what
they were doing.</p>

<p>Seeing that these threats and demonstrations made
no difference in the speed of the boat, he leaped
toward Jule, who stood by the open hatchway over
the motors. While the deck was kept closed over the
machinery on ordinary occasions, it was so arranged
that a square of the deck lifted like a patch above the
motors whenever special attention was being given
to them.</p>

<p>The Spaniard was almost to the boy when Case
tripped him and he fell headlong to the deck.
Captain Joe stood watching him for a moment,
showing his teeth, and then lay down within a foot
of the fellow’s face, his lips snarling, his jaws working.</p>

<p>“If you try to get up we can’t restrain the dog,”
Case said, gravely, “so if you think anything of
your hide you’d better remain where you are.”</p>

<p>The row-boat followed the <i>Rambler</i> out into the
river for a short distance and then turned back. As
she did so the smoke of a steamer lifted to the east.</p>

<p>The Spaniard continued his verbal attacks on the
boys, though he was careful not to swing his arms
nearer to Captain Joe.</p>

<p>“What is he saying?” asked Case.</p>

<p>“He is saying that this is piracy,” answered
Frank.</p>

<p>“And the worst of it is that he is right,” grumbled
Case. “What are we ever going to do with this
fellow. It isn’t fair to take him off with us just
because he wants his money.”</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t,” admitted Frank, “but we’re in a
tight fix.”</p>

<p>“I’ll help him off when he wants to go!” Jule
volunteered. “I’ll pitch him overboard!”</p>

<p>“Play fair!” urged Case. “We’re in a sorry
plight, but play fair!”</p>

<p>“He isn’t playing fair!” asserted Jule. “He
heard of our trouble, and came right down to take
possession of the boat. I believe he knows
something about that robbery.”</p>

<p>When the row-boat turned back the <i>Rambler</i> was
slowed down so as to keep abreast of the current.
The Spaniard was still cursing wildly, and Frank
was saying something to him which appeared to
make him all the more indignant.</p>

<p>“If he was in Massachusetts,” laughed Jule,
“he’d want the state troops called out!”</p>

<p>“What are we going to do with him?” asked
Case, and Frank shook his head gravely. “Looks
like he has the law with him!”</p>

<p>Then the cabin door opened and Alex came running
out with a handful of banknotes waving aloft,
his feet fairly dancing along the deck, his lips set
for one long whoop, which, being finished, gave the
boys a chance to ask questions.</p>

<p>“Where did you get it?”</p>

<p>“Is there a bank in there?”</p>

<p>“How much is there in the roll?”</p>

<p>This last from Jule, who beckoned to Alex to
call Captain Joe off guard duty. The dog left
reluctantly and joined Clay in the cabin, for the boy
who was in a degree responsible for the situation
insisted on remaining out of sight until he had
“had it out with himself,” as he expressed it.</p>

<p>“Now,” Case snapped out, catching Alex by the
shoulder and facing him around. “You keep still
long enough to tell us if you’ve found a mine of
banknotes in the cabin just when we were in great
need. Get on with the story!”</p>

<p>Alex was too excited to talk for a time. He just
danced up and down and shook the fluttering ends
of the banknotes in the faces of his chums whenever
he came in contact with him. In the meantime the
Spaniard had arisen to his feet, and now, the
Rambler having stopped, stood beckoning to the men in
the row-boat to come on.</p>

<p>“Where’s your bill?” asked Case, approaching
the gesticulating merchant. “We’re going to cash
up. Here, Alex, bring me that money!”</p>

<p>Alex calmly drew a $50 banknote between each
of the fingers of his right hand and waved it in
the hot air, like a fan.</p>

<p>“Give him our notes!” he said. “Frank accepts ’em!”</p>

<p>Finally Case secured the statement which the
fellow had brought on board for payment and
handed it over to Frank.</p>

<p>“It is $100,” said the boy, “and most of the
charges are double what they should be.”</p>

<p>“Well, what can we do about it?”</p>

<p>“I’ll see.”</p>

<p>Frank continued his talk with the fellow, who
was now shaking his head and pointing to the
advancing boat. Jule started the motors again and
the distance between the two craft increased.</p>

<p>“He won’t take paper money,” Frank said. “He
demands gold.”</p>

<p>“All right!” Case cried.</p>

<p>The boy took the paper into his hand, thrust two
$50 banknotes into the unwilling hand of the
merchant—who looked on in rage and wonder at
the bold action!—and handed out a pencil. As long
as the row-boat containing the officers was coming
on, the fellow would not sign the receipt, insisting
that exchange fees must be added, but when the
<i>Rambler</i> began to edge out toward the Amazon he
seized the pencil with a growl and wrote his name
under the column of charges.</p>

<p>This done, he pointed to the row-boat, asking
Frank to permit it to come along side, in order to
take him off. Frank consented to this, and the boat
drew nearer.</p>


<p>“If those officers get within reaching distance I’m
afraid they’ll make us trouble.”</p>

<p>This from Case, who stood by Alex and Captain
Joe, the latter looking disappointed at the apparently
peaceful solution of the trouble.</p>

<p>Alex grinned and whispered to Captain Joe. The
dog cocked up his ears and opened his jaws with a
snarl.</p>

<p>“Say, mister,” Alex called out to the Spaniard,
then, “I can’t control this dog much longer.
Jump!”</p>

<p>“He doesn’t understand!” Case observed. “I
wish he did!”</p>

<p>“Tell him, Frank!” Alex ordered.</p>

<p>As Frank ceased speaking, after this request,
Alex let the dog out at arm’s length, holding only
to the collar they had made for him. He made as
if he were nearly exhausted holding the animal, now
clawing the deck, and the Spaniard stepped to the
side of the boat.</p>

<p>Alex let go his hold, the dog sprang forward,
and the merchant jumped into the river, making a
great touse as he struck the surface on his back and
dropped under.</p>

<p>“Hope he’ll drown!” was Jule’s observation.</p>

<p>“No; he won’t drown. The row-boat is heading
this way and will pick him up. Now, perhaps we’d
better be on our way. I rather think we have
committed assault and battery—or, rather, that Captain
Joe has—on that chap, and he may want us all
arrested.”</p>

<p>Alex laughed as he spoke, making faces at the
angry men in the boat. Directly the merchant was
hauled, streaming and vociferating, from the river.
Then the <i>Rambler</i> was headed out of the mouth of
the Madeira and was soon breasting the slow
current of the Amazon again.</p>

<p>“Now, about that money!” demanded Case.
“Where did it drop from?”</p>

<p>“Why, you know Captain Joe gave us a package,
to be opened only when we had come to the end
of our rope? Well! we had not only come to the
end of our rope, but had lost the rope!”</p>

<p>“And so you opened Captain Joe’s package?”</p>

<p>“Of course we did.”</p>

<p>“I had forgotten all about it,” Case remarked.</p>

<p>“And so had I,” Alex went on. “It was Clay
who thought of it. He got it and opened it.”</p>

<p>“How much money is there?”</p>

<p>“Three hundred dollars!”</p>

<p>Both Case and Jule gave vent to a low whistle.</p>

<p>“How did he ever save that much money?” Case
asked.</p>

<p>“Why did he give it to us?” was what Jule said.
“It is remarkable,” Frank added.</p>

<p>“Perhaps he wrote something and put it in with
the money,” suggested Case, in a moment.</p>

<p>“Never thought of that!”</p>

<p>Alex bounced into the cabin and came back in a
moment pushing Clay in front of him. Clay, looking
half ashamed, half triumphant, held a sheet of
writing paper in one hand.</p>

<p>“Just read it!” Alex cried out.</p>

<p>Clay held it out so that the large, irregular
character written on it might be seen from a distance.</p>

  <div class='lgc'>
    <div class='line'>“KEEP HER HEAD ON!”</div>
  </div>

<p>That was the message!</p>

<p>It seemed to the boys, all of whom were greatly
affected, that the words had come directly from the
kindly lips of the Captain, straight over four
thousand miles of sea and land, to put them all in good
cheer again.</p>

<p>“Good old Captain Joe!” Jule exclaimed. “How
did he know?”</p>

<p>“Oh, anyone would know that such a fool as I
am—such a heedless fool—would get any company
he traveled with into trouble, and——”</p>

<p>Alex clapped a hand over the speaker’s mouth.</p>

<p>“That will be all for you,” he said.</p>
 </div>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chXVII'>CHAPTER XVII.—NIGHTS ON THE AMAZON</h2>

<p class='first'>Neither then nor at any other time was Clay
permitted to speak to his chums of the loss of the gold.
He was allowed, briefly, to explain that two men
who claimed to be interested in motor boats had
approached him as he re-entered the restaurant,
that he had invited them to seats at the table, where
he had ordered another cup of coffee—the quality
served before having been excellent—that he had
felt drowsy after drinking one cup, and that the next
he knew the boys were pulling him to his feet. That
was all.</p>

<p>There was no doubt in the minds of the boys that
the coffee had been drugged in the kitchen before
being brought to the table, or that the two men were
confederates of the restaurant keeper; but they were
in no position to demand investigation in a hostile
country, and so resolved to continue their journey up
the Amazon and say nothing more about it. There
were even suspicions in the minds of Clay and Case
that the whole thing had been planned by Frank’s
old enemies to keep the <i>Rambler</i> tied up in the
harbor for a long time, as well as to acquire the gold
the boy had so freely shown.</p>

<p>“The people who are trying to keep Frank away
from that strange and mysterious Cloud island are at
the bottom of it,” was Case’s final comment on the
incident.</p>

<p>However, the boys were now well supplied with
gasoline and provisions, and there would be no
further need of stopping at any town for a long
time. Frank seemed to have lost his desire for great
speed, after leaving the Madeira, and so the <i>Rambler</i>
lolled along the river for all the world like a boat
out with a summer-day picnic party.</p>

<p>Now and then the boy watched the down-stream
country with a glass, as if expecting to see a steamer
with green and yellow stripes on her stack shooting
swiftly against the current. Again, he sat for hours
on the little stern platform at night, watching the
river and the shores for a light which he never
discovered.</p>

<p>“What has gotten into the lad?” Case asked, one
night when the <i>Rambler</i> lay at anchor in a bay just
above the Rio Negro river. “He seems to be
watching for some sign or signal, but refuses to tell
what it is.”</p>

<p>No one ventured a reply, and Jule pointed away
to the valley of the Rio Negro.</p>

<p>“That river,” he said, to change the subject, “is
a thousand miles long. Its head waters rise in
Columbia and Guiana. Perhaps some of the water
that trickles down to the Amazon comes from the
oldest land on the continent.”</p>

<p>“I guess not!” Alex interrupted. “The oldest
land is somewhere near the center of Peru.”</p>

<p>“The oldest land is in Guiana,” insisted Jule.
“Many millions of years ago an island rose out of
the water there. That was the first of the
continent of South America. The Andes were forced
up later by the wrinkling of the crust of the earth
as it dried out. But the Andes lifted and lowered a
great many times before they got their noses into
the air for keeps. Why, there is a salt spring 14,000
feet above sea level down here. That deposit of salt
was made when the ocean washed the spot where it
lies!”</p>

<p>“There’s gold down here, too,” Alex declared.
“I’ve read that the gold mines of Peru were sealed
up when the Spanish came, and that they have never
been discovered to this day.”</p>

<p>“What do you know about that, Frank?” asked
Case, as the boy came up.</p>

<p>Frank made no reply, but walked back to his old
place on the rear platform, which he reached by
creeping over the low roof of the cabin.</p>

<p>“Perhaps there is gold on this Cloud island,”
suggested Jule.</p>

<p>“There is something there worth fighting for,”
Case argued. “Then, where did the kid get all that
gold? He brought it out with him, you know, and
hid it in a tree!”</p>

<p>“Ho, ho!” laughed Jule, “there are no twenty-dollar
gold pieces down in the mines of Peru. All
that gold he brought out saw the little old U. S. long
before it saw Peru!”</p>

<p>The boys held many such conversations as this as
they proceeded up the river of their dreams. They
never forgot those days and nights on the Amazon,
the splendid panorama of forest and stream ever
before their eyes, the perfect freedom from the
restraints of city life.</p>

<p>They were nearly under the equator, it is true,
and the heat was almost unbearable at times. The
insects were numerous and annoying. But, after all,
they were out in the open, and they were free! The
average lad of seventeen will endure many privations
and suffer many physical penalties just to be free—to
be brother for a time to the woods, the blue sky, and
the running water!</p>

<p>Many an evening, in spite of the heat, they built
great cooking fires in some alluring cove and made a
supper of fish, turtle eggs dug out of the sand, and
the flesh of a fowl resembling wild turkey. The
boy dearly loves to cook by a campfire! Often they
got into territory which the ants seemed to claim as
their own, and now and then an anaconda or an
alligator supplied a mark for their revolvers.</p>

<p>Those were entrancing moonlit nights. Often
natives came from small villages and visited with
them. Traders are numerous along the Amazon,
and in nearly every settlement of natives there are
some who speak English and Spanish. As a rule the
Indians were friendly and willing to assist in the
capture of game, but now and then the boys were
glad to get away from the vicinity of a town or a
plantation because of the vicious nature of the
natives.</p>

<p>The owners of the plantations they visited were
usually Spanish, or of Spanish descent. Their
workmen were invariably natives. There are more
villages and cities on the banks of the upper Amazon
than the maps show, and the boys made a point of
stopping at most of them. In fact, Frank seemed
determined to hold a conversation with someone
in every settlement they came to. Sometimes he
would go ashore alone in the row-boat and remain
for a long time in conference with a planter or one
employed thereabouts.</p>

<p>“He’s asking questions about Cloud island!”
Jule explained, whenever this strange habit of the
boy’s was referred to.</p>

<p>However, the boys liked best to get away from
all civilization and tie up at night in a little creek or
bay, or in a channel forming one side of an island.</p>

<p>Here they caught fish, fought ants, captured
opossums, and beat the thickets for monkeys and
snakes.</p>

<p>The opossums of Brazil are not much larger than
a good-sized rat, but they are very good eating.
Fish are plentiful, and there is plenty of small game
in the forests, so the boys had lots of fresh food to
eat. In that hot climate, however, it was necessary
to procure fresh game every day, as putrefaction
soon sets in. Fish taken from the river soon
becomes offensive unless cut into thin strips and dried
in the sunshine.</p>

<p>Ever since leaving the Madeira the boys had slept
in hammocks swung from strong uprights on the
forward deck. The deck was shut in by wire
netting, which afforded them partial protection from
the insects. But of course the impudent blood-seekers
hung constantly about, and more than one
found its way into this screened place when the one
door, opening at the side, was in use.</p>

<p>Lizards of all sizes, shapes and dispositions
managed to take passage on the <i>Rambler</i>, much to
the disgust of the boys and the anger of Captain Joe,
who attacked them relentlessly but could not keep
the boat free of them. But if the lizards and
snakes and ants were unwelcome guests on the boat
and at the little camps, there were plenty of other
visitors who more than compensated for them.
These were the birds, whose shrill voices and
brilliant coloring made the night as well as the day
musical and gay. Taken all in all, the life the boys
lived there on the mighty river, under the equator,
was ideal from a boy’s viewpoint.</p>

<p>There were, besides many birds well known at the
North, kingfishers, green and blue tree-creepers,
purple-headed tanagers, and humming birds.
Butterflies were everywhere, of every size and color.
And there were the cicadas, at home in every tree,
sending out their jarring, reedy notes. The forests
were alive with sound, and the lads realized that
even the roar of Chicago would sometimes be small
beside the constant ring of wild life.</p>

<p>One of the native weapons in use on the upper
Amazon quite fascinated Jule, and he never gave
over bartering with the Indians until he secured one.
This was a zarabatana, or blow-gun. It consists of
a hollow tube through which an arrow is shot by
the breath. The arrows are sharp as a needle and
are winged with fluff from the seed-vessels of the
cotton tree. The arrows are expelled with such
force that the sound of their exit from the muzzle
is something like that made by a popgun. They are
frequently tipped with the fatal urari poison.</p>

<p>One night, under the brilliant light of the moon,
the boys saw a black tiger or jaguar drinking at the
edge of the little creek in which their boat lay.
They were anxious to take the fellow’s hide as a
souvenir of the trip, and so Clay and Alex cautiously
left the boat and struck into the forest back of the
spot where the tiger was quenching his thirst. He
threw up his muzzle and dropped his ears, like a
great cat, at the first motion on the shore.</p>

<p>Captain Joe, quivering with excitement, and
entirely beyond control, leaped to the shore and
headed for the tiger, which backed, snarling, into
the jungle which the boys had thought to surround.
The dog followed on until he reached the spot from
which the beast had disappeared. In a moment
Alex and Clay were at his side, the former trying
to force his way into the thicket. Finally he pressed
in a yard or two and called to the dog to follow.</p>

<p>But Captain Joe was evidently going out of the
tiger-hunting game without loss of time, for he
tilted his nose in the air, gave one growl of defiance,
and walked away in a very dignified manner indeed.</p>

<p>“There,” Clay exclaimed, “Captain Joe knows
more about tigers than we do, so we’ll go back to
the <i>Rambler</i>.”</p>

<p>The waters of the upper Amazon are filled with
alligators of all sizes. They occasionally swarmed
about the boat, and Captain Joe appeared to enjoy
watching their hungry little eyes as they gazed up
at his plump shoulders. Sometimes, while sleeping
in rude hammocks swung from trees and poles on
sandy shores, the boys were disturbed by the reptiles.</p>

<p>After midnight, however, the alligators keep away
from the sands of the shores, at least where there is
a considerable stretch of it, for the radiation of heat
during the night from the sand makes these resting
spots cool, even chilly, in the morning.</p>

<p>And so the boys leisurely proceeded up the
Amazon, stopping to fish, to hunt turtle eggs, to
watch the monkeys climbing the great trees, to hunt
the black tiger in the thickets and the alligators in
the rivers. They frequently spoke with traders on
the river, and now and then heard news from
Chicago.</p>

<p>At last, along about the middle of September,
they came to Tabatinga, where the Amazon enters
Ecuador. Here they secured additional supplies of
gasoline and such provisions as they would need and
made a few repairs to the boat. The upper Amazon
country is never very “dry,” as storms are likely to
come on at any time during the early fall, so the
boys set up a little stove in the cabin and made ready
for the days of slow rain and wind which might
come on.</p>

<p>From the time of leaving Marajo island they had
not seen or heard of the <i>Señorita</i>, and the boys,
all save Frank, were flattering themselves that the
pursuit had ceased. They had passed, and been
passed, by many steamers on the river, but none of
them resembled the little vessel they had first seen
on the South Branch. But at Tabatinga their dream
of being free from pursuit by Frank’s enemies
vanished.</p>
 </div>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chXVIII'>CHAPTER XVIII.—JUST AHEAD OF A MOB</h2>

<p class='first'>The <i>Rambler</i> lay in front of Tabatinga, ready to
take to the reaches of the upper river, one morning,
when Jule called Clay’s attention to a small steamer,
painted a silver gray, which was steaming into a
crude slip not far away.</p>

<p>“That boat looks familiar,” the boy said. “How
many times have we passed her on the way up?”</p>

<p>Clay viewed the boat critically and then went for
his glass. Frank had heard the question, seen Clay
take the glass from the hook on the wall of the cabin,
and followed to the side of the boat. Clay looked
long at the steamer and then handed the glass to
Frank.</p>

<p>“What do you make of her?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Which way did she come from?” asked the
boy, placing the glass in position.</p>

<p>“Up river,” answered Jule, at an inquiring glance
from Clay.</p>

<p>“That’s strange!” Frank exclaimed.</p>

<p>“What is?” demanded Jule.</p>

<p>“The <i>Señorita</i> coming from that direction,” was
the reply.</p>

<p>“The <i>Señorita</i>!” repeated Clay, in amazement.</p>

<p>“Just what I thought!” Jule declared.</p>

<p>“So that is our escort, all in a new suit of
clothes!” Alex grinned, looking over Frank’s
shoulder at the freshly-painted steamer.</p>

<p>“There is no doubt about it,” Frank replied.
“But I can’t understand why she is coming down
stream.”</p>

<p>“She’s been investigating Cloud island,” laughed
Alex.</p>

<p>“That is no joke,” Jule cut in. “Do you see our
friend with the scar and the funny little black
mustache?” he added.</p>

<p>“Señor Lewiso?” asked Frank. “Yes, he is on
board, and is looking this way.”</p>

<p>“Give him the merry ha, ha!” advised Jule.</p>

<p>“So that is his name?” Clay asked, turning to
Frank. “Señor Lewiso. You never mentioned that
before!”</p>

<p>“There was no occasion,” Frank said.</p>

<p>While the boys inspected the <i>Señorita</i>, Señor
Lewiso descended into a small boat and was taken
ashore.</p>

<p>“I wish I knew what he wants in the town,” Frank mused.</p>

<p>“Supplies, probably,” Clay suggested.</p>

<p>Frank shook his head.</p>

<p>“There is little need of her buying supplies here,”
he said, “for she has large provision refrigerators,
and, besides, most of the food supply up here would
naturally come from the forest and river.”</p>

<p>“Then he is going ashore to find out something
about the <i>Rambler</i>. Perhaps he did not see us.”</p>

<p>This from Alex, who was now preparing for the
shore.</p>

<p>“Rest assured that he did see us!” Frank replied,
noting the boy’s preparations for a visit to the city.
“Where are you going?”</p>

<p>“Why, don’t you want to know what he’s up to?”
asked Alex.</p>

<p>“Of course, but you——”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes I can!” broke in the boy. “I can take
Captain Joe with me and shadow him like a Sherlock
Holmes!”</p>

<p>“Of course we can!” decided Jule, also making
ready for a visit to the city. “You see, he doesn’t
know us, and——”</p>

<p>“Don’t you ever think he doesn’t!” Case
interrupted. “That boat lay close to the <i>Rambler</i> in
the South Branch for a number of days, and you may
be sure that he has a mental photo of everyone of
us. Better cut this visit out!”</p>

<p>“You said,” turning to Frank, “that you would
like to know what he wanted in the city! Well,
then!”</p>

<p>“Run along!” Clay decided, seeing that Frank
was about to appeal to him for advice. “I see no
harm in the boys going, but they would better leave
Captain Joe on the boat.”</p>

<p>“I guess Captain Joe wants to feel the soil under
his feet, just the same as we do,” Alex exclaimed,
patting the dog on the head, “but we’ll leave him
on board if you think best.”</p>

<p>“He will be certain to get into a quarrel with
some Brazilian pup,” laughed Jule, “and may bring
on international complications, so we’d better kiss
him bye-bye and be on our way.”</p>

<p>The lads went ashore in the boat while Captain
Joe stood on the prow and threw glances of sorrow
and reproach at them. When they reached the
shore, however, Alex gave out a long, shrill whistle
and the next moment Captain Joe was in the river,
swimming to his feet!</p>

<p>“Go it!” Case stormed. “He’ll get you into a
fight, and we’ll have to come and get you out. Go it,
and have all the fun you want to, but lookout for
squalls.”</p>

<p>“That is the first evil forecast I have heard from
you in a long time,” laughed Clay.</p>

<p>“We’ve had too much of the real thing lately,”
grinned Case, “to need any imaginary woes. Say,
I’m going to quit that prophet-of-evil role!”</p>

<p>“I hope so,” Clay responded.</p>

<p>During the absence of the boys and the dog Frank
moved restlessly about the hot little cabin and the
crowded forward deck. It was plain to both Clay
and Case that he anticipated something important
as a result of the trip ashore.</p>

<p>Alex and Jule were reckless and full of pranks,
but he knew them to be courageous, resourceful and
tenacious of any purpose undertaken. He thought
they would have little difficulty in finding the man
they sought. The only question in his mind was as
to whether they would not, by some prankish trick,
get themselves into trouble with the people of the
town.</p>

<p>Señor Lewiso would not molest them. He knew
that very well. He thought he understood the man
thoroughly, and counted on his trying to make
friends with the lads instead of antagonizing them.
Clay questioned him in vain when he said as much
to his chum. Frank would not talk of the man, his
object in following them, or of the secrets of Cloud
island.</p>

<p>Noon came and the boys were still absent. Then
Captain Joe came to the shore where the row-boat
lay and set up a request to be taken on board, as they
thought. Thinking that it might be just as well to
have the boat alongside, Case stripped to the waist
and plunged into the river, swimming with long,
steady strokes to the shore.</p>

<p>Captain Joe pranced, barking, around him, but
would not enter the boat. Instead he seized Case
by one trousers leg and invited him to take a stroll
into the city, much to the delight of a crowd of boys
and adult loafers lounging about the water front.</p>

<p>“What is it, Captain?” asked Case, as if the
dog could answer him. “Where did you leave the
boys?”</p>

<p>Again the dog drew at his clothes, urging him in
the direction of the town.</p>

<p>“But I can’t go in this swimming rig,” said Case,
arguing with the dog as he would have argued with
one of his chums. “You wait here while I go on
board and dress, then I’ll go with you.”</p>

<p>The dog expressed his dissatisfaction with this
arrangement by a series of growls, but Case entered
the boat and rowed to the <i>Rambler</i>, where he found
Clay and Frank ready for the shore, they having
seen the dog’s pantomime from the deck.</p>

<p>“Just as I thought,” Case grumbled. “They’ve
gone and got into some trouble and sent the dog to
tell us about it.”</p>

<p>The situation looked grave, but Clay smiled as he
nudged the boy in the ribs.</p>

<p>“You were going to quit that!” he said.</p>

<p>“Well,” Case responded, with a grin, “they’ve
found a diamond mine, and have sent the dog to
notify us to come and help carry away the wealth.
Does that suit you any better?”</p>

<p>“Surely, that is much better!” smiled Clay.</p>

<p>In the meantime Captain Joe was sitting on the
little dock where the boat had been moored in a
very dignified attitude, his snarly nose pointing up
the street which ended at the river. This was not
the main street of the town, but one running back of
the thoroughfare where most of the places of
business were situated. It was a street where old
warehouses and cheap eating and drinking places
predominated.</p>

<p>“See Captain Joe!” Frank exclaimed; “he
scents mischief up there. We would better be on
our way.”</p>

<p>“Someone must remain on the <i>Rambler</i>,” Clay
declared, “and you, Frank, ought to be the one.
He, this Señor Lewiso, is not after us, but he may
make trouble for you.”</p>

<p>“What a name!” Case exclaimed. “I’ll wager
that his name is just plain Lewis in the United
States.”</p>

<p>“That is probably correct,” Clay agreed. “Now
for it!”</p>

<p>Then the actions of the dog attracted their
attention. He no longer held his dignified pose, but
was running to and fro on the dock, looking
alternately at the <i>Rambler</i> and the street beyond the
dock, as if in doubt whether to chase up the street
or swim to the boat. Presently he darted away up
the street.</p>

<p>Believing that something serious was happening
to Alex and Jule, Clay and Case now sprang into
the boat and rowed ashore. There was then no
need for them to advance up the street taken by
Captain Joe.</p>

<p>An excited mob was rushing down the thoroughfare,
and at the head of it, covering the ground
like race-horses and dodging sticks and clubs as
they shot ahead, were Alex and Jule.</p>

<p>The boys were not very far ahead of the crowd,
but were gaining. Indeed, they would soon have
been beyond the reach of the missiles thrown in
their direction only for the fact that fresh recruits
were continually swinging into the race from nearby
doorways and taking front positions in the pursuit.</p>

<p>Captain Joe was running at the heels of his master,
pausing now and then to check the pursuit by
showing a dangerous set of teeth to the pursuers.
At such times those in advance fell back sullenly,
not caring to come to close quarters with the dog.</p>

<p>When the boys reached the dock they were only
a few paces ahead of the front line of those who
were giving chase. One sturdy fellow, far in
advance, evidently a Spaniard, was even reaching out
to seize Alex when he came to the boat. He might
have succeeded in his attempt to prevent the lad
getting into the craft only that the dog sprang at
him and bore him back. As the two boys and the
dog gained the boat the oncoming rabble stumbled
over the prostrate man and half a dozen pitched
headforemost into the river.</p>

<p>These seemed to be too much astonished at their
sudden immersion to seize the boat or the oars, and
so detain the boys, although those in the rear
shouted to them to do so, and Clay pushed out into
the current. While members of the mob sprang for
nearby boats, Frank set the motors going and picked
up the boys halfway to the dock.</p>

<p>Then the <i>Rambler</i>, for the second time during
that trip, glided away, leaving an angry, vindictive
mob howling at her crew from the shore. Once on
the boat, and the boat showing clear water between
herself and the dock, Alex and Jule dropped down
on deck and set up a succession of mad shouts which
echoed over the stream. Captain Joe put his paws
on the railing at the screen door and deliberately
winked first one eye and then the other at the
defeated runners! Alex declares to this day that he
did it just to provoke his former antagonists!</p>

<p>“Now, what is it all about?” asked Clay, as the
<i>Rambler</i> shot up the Amazon at full speed. “Can’t
you boys go on shore without bringing a mob of
uninvited guests back with you?”</p>

<p>“That is our escort!” grinned Jule, waving an
arm in the direction of the gesticulating crowd on
the dock.</p>

<p>“How did you happen to stir up such a hornet’s
nest?” asked Case.</p>

<p>“It was this way,” Alex began, whistling to the
dog and taking his head into his lap as he sat on the
deck, “when we got up there into the town we
saw—. Guess?”</p>

<p>“Lewiso,” suggested Clay.</p>

<p>“Give it up!” cried Case. “Go on!”</p>

<p>“Well, we saw, not the man we went to look up,
but the two Englishmen we had the skirmish with in
the bush down on Ruination creek!”</p>

<p>“Then they must have passed us on a steamer,”
Frank interrupted. “How were they dressed?”</p>

<p>“Fine! Oh, they’ve made a raise since we saw
them trying to steal the <i>Rambler</i>!”</p>

<p>“That is why I failed to hear or see anything of
them along the river as we came up,” Frank mused.</p>

<p>“So, when you were watching night and day
that is why!” Case cried. “Did you think they
would walk up?”</p>

<p>“I thought that they, being down on their luck,
would be obliged to make their way from town to
town on tramp trading vessels, and that I might hear
of them somewhere.”</p>

<p>“They look like they owned a yacht of their own
now,” Jule put in. “They sure have robbed a bank
somewhere.”</p>

<p>“Go on with your story,” Clay suggested, as the
<i>Señorita</i> left the dock and started up stream. “If
you have good luck you may be able to tell us what
is going on before that steamer comes up with us.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” Jule said, taking up the story,
“Alex had to follow the Englishmen into a restaurant,
where they were eating some funny contraption
and drinking something that looked like rum. They
were so busy they did not see us at first—busy over
papers which looked like maps they took from their
pockets!”</p>

<p>“Maps!” echoed Frank, excitedly.</p>

<p>“Yes, maps, and they laid the bunch of papers
down on the table, and they looked good to me,
and so I sent Captain Joe after them.”</p>

<p>“You did?” shouted Clay and Case in a breath.
“Did he get them?”</p>

<p>This from Frank, whose eyes were shining with
a spirit the boys never seen there before.</p>

<p>“Get them?” repeated Jule. “Of course he got
them, and handed them to me, and we beat it for
the boat, and the Englishmen followed with a mob
at their heels, and we hotfooted it down the street.”</p>

<p>“But Captain Joe——”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know he got to the dock a long time
before we did, for we got sidetracked and had to hide
from the mob in an old warehouse. It was while
we were in there that Captain Joe left us, and came
after you.”</p>

<p>“But the mob never found us,” Alex exclaimed,
“until we broke and ran for the river. I guess the
Englishmen are looking for us back there in the
warehouse yet.”</p>

<p>“The papers?” asked Frank. “Where are
they?”</p>

<p>Alex laid a packet on the deck by his side.</p>

<p>“What are they?” he asked, provokingly holding
them down with one hand as Frank, catching sight
of one, reached for them.</p>

<p>“Maps of Cloud island!” was the quick reply.</p>
 </div>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chXIX'>CHAPTER XIX.—THE SECRET OF CLOUD ISLAND</h2>

<p class='first'>The boys gathered around Frank as he took the
papers into his hands and ran them over hastily.</p>

<p>“Are they really maps of Cloud island?” asked
Clay.</p>

<p>“Where is this Cloud island?” demanded Alex,
grinning at the old question.</p>

<p>“What are the maps good for?” added Jule.</p>

<p>“How far is it to Cloud island?” asked Case.</p>

<p>“One question at a time, boys,” smiled Frank.
“I’ll tell you all about Cloud island now.”</p>

<p>This statement was so extraordinary, in view of
the boy’s previous reticence on the subject, that even
Captain Joe arose and looked the speaker in the face
and wagged his tail in applause.</p>

<p>“Cloud island,” began Frank, but Clay caught
him by the arm and pointed to the <i>Señorita</i>, now
under full headway, steaming up the river.</p>

<p>“There comes your Señor Lewiso,” he raid.</p>

<p>“Looks like he wants our maps!” Alex observed.</p>

<p>The boys, at Frank’s request, did not increase the
speed of the <i>Rambler</i>. Instead, they loitered in
order that the <i>Señorita</i> might come up with them.</p>

<p>“What’s the notion?” asked Alex. “You ain’t
going to give up those maps, are you, Frank!”</p>

<p>“Did you met this Señor Lewiso while on
shore?” Frank answered the question with another,
as the steamer came abreast of the <i>Rambler</i>.</p>

<p>The boy shook his head.</p>

<p>“We were too busy doing those other chaps out
of the maps,” he said.</p>

<p>When the <i>Señorita</i> came abreast the young man
with the scar on his face was seen on deck, gazing
impudently at the boys.</p>

<p>“Fine day!” yelled Jule, making a wry face.</p>

<p>Clay gave a gesture of disapproval, but the boy
went on:</p>

<p>“Is this your river?”</p>

<p>There was no answer whatever from Señor Lewiso,
but someone not in view called out, in good English:</p>

<p>“You know it! The river and all the islands in
it!”</p>

<p>“Going to take the river up as you pass along?”
demanded Alex.</p>

<p>“Oh, quit it!” Case exclaimed. “There is nothing
to be gained by that sort of thing.”</p>

<p>“He looked so bossy,” commented Alex, “that I
didn’t know but he had the key to the river in his
pocket! He doesn’t look good to me, no way you
can put it!”</p>

<p>The <i>Señorita</i> swept on, and was soon lost to sight
behind an island. Then an entirely unexpected sight
presented itself.</p>

<p>A boat which looked like a launch, fitted with
motors and well filled with tanks and crates, shot out
of a little bay and followed the steamer. Frank
sprang for the glass and succeeded in getting a good
view of the two occupants before the craft made the
angle of the island just ahead.</p>

<p>“Where did that come from?” questioned Jule.
“Say, but she is going after the <i>Señorita</i>!”</p>

<p>“It looks that way,” agreed Alex.</p>

<p>“There go the two Englishmen!” Frank said,
laying down the glass, as the launch disappeared
from sight. “They are going to follow the <i>Señorita</i>
to Cloud island.”</p>

<p>“Whew!” ejaculated Case. “This Cloud island
seems to be in good demand. I hope they won’t
carry it away before we get there!”</p>

<p>“Go on and tell us about it now,” Alex said,
turning to Frank. “The pursuers are all in the
lead!”</p>

<p>“Yes, we’re all crazy to know about Cloud
island!” Jule added.</p>

<p>“But there is one thing I don’t understand,” Case
observed. “These people have been following on
behind us up to now. Why do they shoot ahead at
this stage of the race?”</p>

<p>Frank’s face broke into a smile.</p>

<p>“It seems to me,” he replied, “that I am believed
by my enemies to be out of the game just now!
They appear to have left me for the pleasure of
pursuing each other!”</p>

<p>“And you are sauntering along in order that they
may have their wish and fight it out between themselves.</p>

<p>“Something like that,” Frank replied. “When
we met those two men on Ruination creek, I knew
that they would keep the Señor Lewiso rather busy,
if they succeeded in getting up the river. I doubted
their ability to continue their journey, for they
seemed to be in hard luck, but, thinking they might,
I watched and inquired all along to see if they had
gone on up ahead of us.”</p>

<p>“I thought you acted strangely,” Clay said.</p>

<p>“I had about given up all idea of their being
anywhere near here when the boys came upon them
to-day,” Frank went on. “Where they secured their
outfit is more than I can imagine, but they certainly
are in the contest in excellent form. The Señor
Lewiso will be troubled when he sees the launch
chasing him.”</p>

<p>“Will the first one at Cloud island get what they
are all going after?” questioned Jule. “Will they
get what we are going in search of, do you think.”</p>

<p>“Of course not!” Alex answered. “Don’t you
forget that Frank knows what’s he doing, loitering
along the river. I guess he knows what he is about
part of the time!”</p>

<p>“The fact is,” Frank replied, guardedly, “that
neither one of them can secure the Cloud island prize
without help from me.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” grunted Jule.</p>

<p>“Then they’ll have to wait for you to come up?”
asked Alex. “If that is the idea, why don’t they
stick around with you?”</p>

<p>“Each one,” laughed Frank, “seems to have the
idea that the other possesses the information I have.”</p>

<p>“I see!” grinned Alex. “And you’re going to
let ’em fight it out?”</p>

<p>“That is my present intention.”</p>

<p>“But if they fight it out and discover that they
have fought the wrong parties, what then?”</p>

<p>“Then the ones left alive will want to fight it out
with me!”</p>

<p>“Then there’s going to be a scrap!” Jule exclaimed.
“Some day they are sure to find out that
they’ve each been watching the wrong party!”</p>

<p>“Now, if you have satisfied the curiosity of these
young sleuths,” Clay remarked, “perhaps they will
permit you to tell us about Cloud island, and what
reward is sought there.”</p>

<p>From far up the shining surface of the river, its
sound somewhat deadened by the intervening island,
came the report of a gun. In a minute there came a
second shot.</p>

<p>“The <i>Señorita</i> doesn’t like to be hugged by the
launch!” smiled Case.</p>

<p>“It is a case of war there!” Frank observed.
“I’m glad I have two parties opposed to me instead
of one! They enjoy fighting each other, it seems!”</p>

<p>“Every time you get ready to tell us about Cloud
island,” Clay laughed, “there is an interruption.
Let them fight it out, if they will, and you go on with
the story of that wonderful place.”</p>

<p>Another reverberation came down the river, and
then silence. There was no more shooting at that
time.</p>

<p>“Nearly a thousand miles from here, as the river
runs,” Frank began, “the Amazon turns south and
follows a valley running along between two giant
ridges of the Andes. Three or four hundred miles
from the point where it changes its course, it finds
its source in a small mountain lake. This lake is not
much more more than one hundred miles from Lima,
the capital of Peru.”</p>

<p>“The Amazon draws water almost from the
Pacific!” Jule interrupted.</p>

<p>“Yes, it comes very near crossing the continent
of South America,” Frank went on. “Well, about
half way between the source and the point I have
mentioned lies Cloud island, not in the center of
the river, but so setting over to a rocky shore that
the channel between the rocks and the island is
very narrow at low water.”</p>

<p>“Low water?” asked Alex. “What makes high
and low water away up in the Andes?”</p>

<p>“Rains, of course,” replied Frank. “During
the wet season, which is due to begin up there
before long, now, the Amazon sometimes rises from
twenty to forty feet. Well, it is these inundations
that make Cloud island valuable.”</p>

<p>“Like the valley of the Nile,” Alex hinted.</p>

<p>“Not at all in that way! It is believed that Cloud
island was once an active volcano. Its top lifts
above the river, at low water, about thirty feet.
The summit is not more than ten acres in extent,
and is as level as this deck, except that it tips
gradually to the north.”</p>

<p>“Just a mountain tableland?” asked Alex.</p>

<p>“Yes, and not a very high one at that. But what
makes the upper level so peculiar is that in the
center there is a great crater, which sends out smoke and
steam which at times hide the land. Hence the
name Cloud island.”</p>

<p>“Why, of course!” Jule interrupted. “That is
a volcanic region. But I have never heard of any
Cloud island volcano!”</p>

<p>“It isn’t a volcano,” Frank went on. “There
is never any eruption, never has been one since the
records of that region were opened. Deep down in
the crater are monster caverns, from which lava was
tossed years ago, and at the bottom of some of
these are crevices through which the steam seeps.”</p>

<p>“I’ll get a Russian bath when I get there!” Alex
promised himself.</p>

<p>“You’ll get the hide scalded off you, if you go
down there!” Jule advised. “Won’t he, Frank?”</p>

<p>“He will unless he knows where to go,” was the
reply. “The steam guards well the secret of those
caverns.</p>

<p>“Any gold there?” asked Case.</p>

<p>“Yes, plenty of it.”</p>

<p>“So that is what they are all after! Well, why
don’t they get it?”</p>

<p>“Do they have to dive for it?” asked Case.
“The caverns must be full of water, if they are
deep.”</p>

<p>“The water in the crater follows the surface of
the river, of course,” Frank answered. “When
there is high water, the current sweeps over the
mouth of the crater, and when there is low water
the bottoms of some of the caverns are dry—the
caverns which are shallow in comparison with the
others.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got it now!” roared Alex.</p>

<p>“Smarty!” Jule reproved.</p>

<p>“What is it you’ve got?” asked Case.</p>

<p>“The answer!” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Give it, then!”</p>

<p>“There is plenty of gold in the mountains of
Peru,” Alex went on, while Frank leaned back with
a smile on his face. “I have read that there are
solid deposits a mile wide there.” he went on, with
a nudge at Jule. “The mother lode, in fact! Well,
the waters carry this gold out of crevices when it
is at its highest and pass it down the river. And
some day the river, at high water, deposited a great
quantity of gold in one of the caverns Frank speaks
of, and that gold is what all this mess is about. Is
that right, Frank?”</p>

<p>“Very nearly right!” Frank replied. “Years
ago, a very ocean of water swept down the Andes
and rushed through the valley, which is narrow and
rocky. During this period of high water, a great
quantity of gold was washed out of a mine and
carried down, and a large amount of what was swept
over Cloud island lodged in the caverns—in one
cavern especially, and there my father found it. It
is there still, for he died before he could bring it
out! It is this cavern those people ahead are seeking.”</p>

<p>“And you know right where it is?” asked Jule.
“What a snap!”</p>
 </div>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chXX'>CHAPTER XX.—A CALL FOR HELP</h2>

<p class='first'>“Then why didn’t you get it out a long time
ago?” asked Alex. “If I knew where there was a
bunch of gold, I’d buy three automobiles and a
motor boat that would fly in the air!”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t get it out,” Frank replied. “I was
watched by thieves! The minute my father died
this Señor Lewiso, who had long been in the employ
of my father in the trading business, began
watching me and searching for the cavern.”</p>

<p>“The caverns!” corrected Case.</p>

<p>“You let him tell this story!” Alex exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Perhaps caverns is more accurate,” Frank
laughed, “but it is with one special cavern that we
have to do. There is only one cavern which is believed
to be full of gold. Father declared that it
held millions, and I have no reason to doubt either
his judgment or his word.”</p>

<p>“It ought to be easy to find, if he found it,” Jule
broke in.</p>

<p>“But it isn’t easy to find, unless you know just
where to look for it,” Frank continued. “As I
have already stated, some of the caverns show
fissures through which steam oozes at times, forming
misty clouds about the island. In these caverns
there is no gold, or a very little, if any, as the rush
of the water carries it through the openings to
unknown depths below.</p>

<p>“During the great inundation I have referred to,
gold was swept by the current into a cavern where
there were no fissures. Subsequent floods and
periods of high water increased the gold deposit in
this cavern. They also covered the yellow metal up
with ooze and earth.”</p>

<p>“Then it is still a guess! Of course, if it is
covered up!”</p>

<p>This from Case, who had hardly breathed during
the latter part of the narrative.</p>

<p>“So, if you don’t know where to locate this
particular cavern,” Frank resumed, “you might hunt
for it for years and never find it.”</p>

<p>“And you really know right where it is?” asked
Clay. “Well, all this was worth while, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“I think so!” smiled the boy.</p>

<p>“Do any of these other people know?” asked Jule.</p>

<p>“They have only a faint idea as to where the
gold is, but they are counting on taking their time
and hunting until they find it.”</p>

<p>“They may finally blunder on it,” Case remarked.</p>

<p>He was about to say more, but, remembering his
recent promise to get out of the role of prophet of
evil, he checked himself, much to the satisfaction of
the others.</p>

<p>“Strictly speaking,” Frank resumed, “the cavern
where the gold is, is not a cavern at all! There was
once a cavern there, but it was filled with gold and
the wash of the mountains, so it now presents a level
surface to the eye of one entering the crater.”</p>

<p>“Is it above water at this time of the year?”
asked the practical Clay.</p>

<p>“Yes, I think so. In order to reach the gold, one
must enter one of the steam caverns and cut through
to the one filled with gold and gravel. This is what
has puzzled them all, for there are many of these
steam holes, large and small, and one to investigate
thoroughly would be obliged to examine the entire
inner surface of each one. Father found the deposit
by accident.”</p>

<p>“What about this Señor Lewiso,” asked Clay.
“You spoke of him in connection with some action
following the death of your father.”</p>

<p>“He found what purported to be a map of the
crater,” answered the boy, “and began digging for
the gold, which he knew to be there somewhere. I
never objected to his quest, as he was all wrong, but
let him go on while I looked for men I could trust
to assist me in getting the gold out.”</p>

<p>“But he must have found some gold,” Jule
argued, “for it took money to get that steamer and
follow you when you went out.”</p>

<p>“He undoubtedly did,” Frank admitted, “but he
did not discover the main body of it. At least it was
intact when I left for Chicago.”</p>

<p>“Why Chicago?”</p>

<p>“Because I believed my father’s people to be
there.”</p>

<p>“And you found them?”</p>

<p>Frank shook his head.</p>

<p>“All dead,” he said, sadly. “On the way out in
my boat I was attacked at the mouth of the Madeira,
as I hinted before. Only for the fact that I hid my
gold, and—and other things—in a tree, I would
have been plucked clean by the Indians this scamp of
a Lewiso sent upon me.</p>

<p>“When I left Ruination creek I left $800 in a
tree, as you know, to come back to, for there was no
telling what luck I would have outside. I left too
much there, as it turned out, for I was hungry and
cold in Chicago, even when I possessed——”</p>

<p>The boy hesitated and Clay gave Case a nudge
on the shoulder.</p>

<p>“Possessed what?” asked Jule.</p>

<p>“Something which would have brought money
and plenty,” was the guarded reply. “I heard of
you boys, and used to hang about the <i>Rambler</i>
nights, wondering if you would let me go with you.
You see, this is an ideal party to go in quest of that
gold,” he went on, “for no one would give us credit
for being anything but a bunch of lads out for a
vacation.”</p>

<p>“And you saw this Lewiso in Chicago, of course?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, and he caused me to be robbed, and
arrested, and put out of hotels as a thief! I shall have
a long account to settle with him when the time
comes!”</p>

<p>“Then why didn’t you go to some man of wealth
and state your ease to him? You could have secured
money enough for the trip back after the gold,”
suggested Clay.</p>

<p>“I tried that,” Frank answered, “but never succeeded
in closing a deal with anyone. Lewiso caused
me to be shadowed, and whenever I interested a
man in the enterprise he sought him out and
discouraged him. At times, until the very last, he
would act friendly toward me, but this was only to
lead me on to confide in him. He probably followed
me when I went to the South Branch pier nights and
learned of my desires. Anyway, he heard plenty of
talk about going to the Amazon, coming from the
<i>Rambler</i>, and doubtless took it for granted that I
had joined hands with you, and that we were going
after the money.”</p>

<p>“You think he bought the steamer there after
hearing of our trip?”</p>

<p>“I am sure of it. He was foolish enough to believe
I would lead the way to the gold and let him
get it!”</p>

<p>“And now where do these Englishmen come in?”
asked Clay, desirous of clearing up the whole
mystery at once.</p>

<p>“I never knew them at Cloud island, but it seems
that they knew of me. One of them, I am almost
certain, was formerly the valet of an English
nobleman who visited father at his home on the upper
Amazon. He undoubtedly interested the other in
the adventure. Where he got the maps the boys
secured is more than I know.”</p>

<p>“Are they valuable?”</p>

<p>“Not worth the paper they are drawn on.”</p>

<p>“Still their loss evidently urged the fellows on,”
Clay mused. “They seem determined, now, to keep
pace with the <i>Señorita</i>, doubtless believing that
Lewiso has secured, while shadowing you, the
needed information regarding the cavern.”</p>

<p>“Something like that,” Frank replied. “I have
often wondered how those two men came to mention
Cloud island at Ruination creek that night,” he
continued. “I can account for it only on the theory
that Ugly, the Indian who was with them there, had
been a member of the party which attacked and
searched me in that vicinity. They engaged him as
guide, and he might have recognized me and told
them about my being a member of the other Cloud
island party which had stopped there.”</p>

<p>“I guess you have that sized up correctly,” Clay
remarked. “I hope,” he went on, with a broad
smile, “to be somewhere near when Lewiso and the
Englishmen meet! Each one thinks the other has
secured from you the important information!”</p>

<p>“In the meantime,” Frank remarked, “we’ll let
them watch and shoot at each other on the way to
Cloud island. We can loiter along the river and
enjoy ourselves.”</p>

<p>“Why not hustle right along, and take no chances
on their getting the gold?” asked Case, the most
enthusiastic member of the party, now that the goal
seemed within reach.</p>

<p>“You boys were planning a good time,” Frank
answered, “when I joined you. You were figuring
on long days and nights on the Amazon, fishing and
hunting. Then I connected with you, bringing my
troubles along as my only baggage! Since then
we’ve been kept busy keeping alive. We have fought
days and kept guard nights, until you must be sick
of your bargain, the bringing of yours truly along.”</p>

<p>“Aw, it’s been fun!” Alex broke in, and the rest
echoed the thought, though not in the same words.
“Besides you had baggage! You’ve got our note
now, this minute for $800!”</p>

<p>“And now,” Frank went on, “I see no reason
why we can’t fall back on the old program, and
loiter along, fishing and hunting and learning
something of the country. As for the note, I’ve burned
that!”</p>

<p>“That will be all right, too!” Jule cut in, “we all
like that! But we’ll pay it all the same, and if you
say that we’ve got any the worst of it by bringing
you along, I’ll set the dog on you.”</p>

<p>“We should have been lacking in excitement!”
Alex added.</p>

<p>“It would have been a quilting party without
you,” Clay laughed. “Your affairs have kept us
busy—but we like to be busy,” he closed with a
friendly poke at Captain Joe, who immediately stood
up on his hind legs and dropped his forepaws into
an attitude of meditation.</p>

<p>“Oh, say what you will about it,” Frank protested,
“I know that I’ve been a marplot all
through, and now I want you boys to join in with
me and have a game old time. Who’s for it?”</p>

<p>Four lusty yells answered the challenge.</p>

<p>“All right, then,” Frank continued, “we’ll tie up
right here, in that little bay, and see what sort of a
country Ecuador is.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to go into the interior,” Clay remarked.</p>

<p>“It seems that the forest is more open here than on
the Madeira.”</p>

<p>“It surely is,” Alex confirmed, “and I move that
we go back from the river a short distance and
look up a jaguar or an ant-eater.”</p>

<p>“Whoo—pee!”</p>

<p>This from Jule, who at once began pulling on a
pair of long-legged boots he had brought with him
from Chicago. The boy was always obsessed to get
into the forest.</p>

<p>“What about weapons?” asked Clay.</p>

<p>“I’ll take my bean-shooter,” Alex proposed.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked Frank.</p>

<p>“Bean-shooter?”</p>

<p>“Yes, what is it?”</p>

<p>Alex brought out his long zarabatana, or blow-gun
and shot an arrow to the shore, twenty paces
away, where it fluttered in the bole of a tree.</p>

<p>“I have used those,” Frank laughed, “but I never
before heard them called bean-shooters.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to hunt with this,” Alex went on.
“If I see a jaguar I’ll fill him so full of arrows that
he’ll look like a feather bed turned wrong side out.”</p>

<p>“And what will he be doing all this time?” asked
Jule.</p>

<p>“Getting out of the way!” roared Alex.</p>

<p>The <i>Rambler</i> was soon anchored, and four of
the lads went ashore, leaving Case in charge of the
boat. It was a beautiful afternoon, though, of
course, very warm, and the boys set out with high
spirits to inspect a bit of Ecuador forest which
fringed a creek emptying into the Amazon.</p>

<p>As they proceeded through the forest Alex came
to a great tree which seemed to have been “slashed,”
as the knights of old “slashed” their doublets. It
was almost red on the outside, and great “slashes”
in the bark showed a tender green. While the boy
was looking at the tree in wonder Frank came up
and, catching one of the reddish strips, peeled it
from the trunk as one peels a banana.</p>

<p>“What kind of a tree is that?” asked Alex.</p>

<p>“Mulatto tree.”</p>

<p>“Why mulatto tree?” asked Jule.</p>

<p>“Because it is black before it begins to shed its
bark.”</p>

<p>“Shed its bark?” repeated Clay.</p>

<p>“It sheds its bark every year, like a snake,” was
Frank’s amazing reply.</p>

<p>Clay ripped off one of the long slabs, disclosing a
pretty green surface underneath.</p>

<p>“That is the new bark,” Frank explained.</p>

<p>Clay dropped the slab of bark and turned it over
with his foot.</p>

<p>“Heavy?” asked Alex.</p>

<p>“As a stone.”</p>

<p>“It makes fine wood, and also fine shingles for a
hut,” Frank went on. “We’ll use some of it to cook
supper with.”</p>

<p>“Cook it now!” urged Alex, his hand on his
stomach.</p>

<p>“Right now!” Jule joined in the hungry request.</p>

<p>“Earn your suppers!” grinned Clay. “Go and
kill a jaguar.”</p>

<p>“But don’t get far from the river,” warned
Frank, “and don’t get lost in the jungle back there.”</p>

<p>“Any bears back there?” asked Jule, with a wink
at Alex.</p>

<p>“There’s worse—snakes a rod long.”</p>

<p>“That’s my snake!” shouted Jule, and off he
went, not stopping to permit Alex to come up with
him.</p>

<p>“That kid has steam enough for a Central Lines
locomotive,” Clay said, as the boy disappeared.
“Do you remember how ill he was that night on the
South Branch?” he added, turning to Frank.</p>

<p>“He looked like death had him,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“And look at him now,” Clay exclaimed, proudly,
“look at him now! There isn’t a healthier lad in
nine states! Hear him yell, in there! Not much
like tuberculosis, eh?”</p>

<p>“No,” Frank agreed, as he put up a hand for Clay
to cease talking.</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>Clay was all anxiety at once.</p>

<p>“Sounds like the kid calling for help. Did he
take a gun with him?”</p>

<p>“Of course.”</p>

<p>“Where’s Alex?”</p>

<p>“He went the other way.”</p>

<p>There was a short silence and then Jule’s voice
rang out, sharp and clear:</p>

<p>“Help! Come on a run!”</p>
 </div>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chXXI'>CHAPTER XXI.—“A NICE, QUIET EXCURSION”</h2>

<p class='first'>“Come a-running!” repeated Jule, his voice
sounding close at hand.</p>

<p>Clay swung his gun to the front as he rushed for
the thicket.</p>

<p>“Be careful!” warned Frank. “If there is a
drove of wild hogs in there, and you should happen
to kill one, they would give you the fight of your
life.”</p>

<p>“Can you follow the sound?” asked Clay, as they
pushed along through the undergrowth.</p>

<p>“Straight ahead,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“But there is a movement in the brush away to
the left. That may be Jule.”</p>

<p>“It is Alex,” panted Frank, for they were moving
fast and having a hard time working their way
through the jungle, which increased in density as
they proceeded. “Can’t you see the point of what
he calls his bean-shooter?” continued Frank. “See,
he is coming this way.”</p>

<p>In a moment Alex joined them as they ran, and
the three made good progress. Only once they
stopped to listen. They had heard nothing from the
boy for a minute or more, and they were not quite
sure they were going in the right direction.</p>

<p>“If he would only shoot, or call again,” Alex
grumbled.</p>

<p>Then the call came, from the dense copse just
ahead:</p>

<p>“Come on a run!”</p>

<p>The voice sounded faint.</p>

<p>“Coming!” exclaimed Alex.</p>

<p>“Come on a run——”</p>

<p>The voice ceased, and Alex darted ahead so fast
that Clay and Frank were left behind. In a moment
they heard him shout:</p>

<p>“Drop your head! Drop it!”</p>

<p>There was no sound for a second, and then a
great tumbling took place on the small growths of
the forest. Then came a sound like the fall of a
heavy body to the ground. This was followed by a
whipping noise, like that made by slapping a rug
against a post to get the dust out of it. And then
the cracking of little bushes and plants, the rustling
of foliage, as if a street sweeper were being drawn
over them.</p>

<p>“Come on in!” yelled Alex.</p>

<p>“The water’s fine!” came Jule’s voice, but it was
not so strong as it had been an hour before.</p>

<p>“What has been going on in there?” asked Clay.
“What is that noise, that slapping, that threshing
about?”</p>

<p>“That’s probably a serpent—a boa—kicking the
bucket,” Frank answered.</p>

<p>“A what?” questioned Clay. “A serpent in
there?”</p>

<p>“Surest thing you know! And I imagine from
familiar sounds that he nearly got Jule!”</p>

<p>“But how?” puzzled Clay.</p>

<p>“Hypnotized him!” Frank answered. “But
come on,” he continued. “We may as well go in
and learn the facts as to stand here and guess.”</p>

<p>They passed through a fringe of thorny vines and
came out in a small glade. In the middle of this
slight clearing stood Alex and Jule, the latter
looking pale and shriveled. At their feet lay the still
writhing body of a giant boa—one of the
constrictor serpents which make the forests of South
America so dangerous.</p>

<p>“Look at him,” Alex shouted, pointing to the
serpent. “Look at the arrow plump through his
neck! Broke the backbone of him at the first shot.
Don’t you ever tell me that I can’t edit one of these
bean-shooters! What? That’s his snake!” he
added, making a face at Jule.</p>

<p>The serpent was still pounding about the glade,
but his backbone had been broken by the boy’s arrow,
and his death was only a question of time. Jule
approached Clay with an apologetic smile on his face.</p>

<p>“He near got me!” he said.</p>

<p>“How?” asked Clay, not having understood
Frank’s short explanation of what might have
taken place.</p>

<p>“I guess he hypnotized me,” answered Jule.
“You see, fellows, I was walking along right here
when I heard a hiss and a sliding motion in the tree,
the one straight ahead. I looked up quick, of
course, and there was that great flat, triangular head
swinging back and forth before my eyes.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you duck and run?”</p>

<p>Jule glanced at Alex scornfully and went on.</p>

<p>“I just couldn’t move. All I could do was to
wag my tongue, and I take it you know what I said.
I don’t. I know my head swayed back and forth in
response to the motions of the snake. I saw all
kinds of bright and beautiful lights in the wicked
eyes of him. I felt his great, sticky face rubbing
against my cheek! Ough!”</p>

<p>“That’s the way they charm birds and monkeys,”
Frank said.</p>

<p>“And then Alex came up and his arrow struck
the serpent in the neck and I was free from the
fascination, but weak—just as weak as a cat!”</p>

<p>“That was a good shot, Alex,” Frank said,
stepping forward to inspect the arrow, which had
passed entirely through the neck of the great reptile,
protruding at both sides.</p>

<p>“It is a wonder!” the boy replied. “I was so
scared that I didn’t know what I was doing. You
see, this great brute had his head right on the kid’s
shoulder. I never saw a human face as white as
his was at that time!”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t any whiter than I felt,” grinned Jule.
The boys finished the serpent with a couple of
shots and started back to the river. They walked a
long ways, but still no water showed in the distance.</p>

<p>Then Frank put out his hand and stood still. When
he put it out to Clay there was a drop of rain in
the palm.</p>

<p>“That’s fine!” Alex exclaimed. “Lost in the
woods and the rain coming down. Now what,
fellows?”</p>

<p>“Who has a searchlight?” asked Clay.</p>

<p>“I have!” answered Jule. “I’ve got one tucked
up under this sweater. Never go away from the
boat without it.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you turn it on the serpent?” asked
Alex, with a most provoking laugh.</p>

<p>“I hope you’ll get a snake on your shoulder some
day!” Jule retorted. “Then you’ll see what you
are capable of doing. Turn it on the serpent!”
he repeated. “Why, I couldn’t have turned it over
in my hand.”</p>

<p>“What do you want of the light?” asked Frank.
“It will soon be dark,” Clay responded, “and
then we shall have hard work finding our way back
to the boat.”</p>

<p>“Unless a miracle takes place,” Frank predicted,
“we’ll remain in the forest to-night. We might
as well try to bore through a mountain with a gimlet
as to pick our way through this jungle in the night.”</p>

<p>“But it rains, and there are snakes and jaguars
abroad!” protested Jule, who was not in favor of
giving the serpents of the forest another chance at
him.”</p>

<p>“A fire will keep them both away.”</p>

<p>With this comforting remark the boy set to work
gathering up the long, red slabs of the mulatto tree.
The boys assisted him in bending and tying down a
small tree and the slabs were put over the horizontal
trunk, slanting to the ground. They were piled
against each other so as to more effectually keep out
the rain, which was now falling in great drops.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Frank, after the roof was on the
proposed habitation of the night, “we’ll build a
fire at one end and pile bark at the other. We shall
have a house as cozy as a bug-in-a-rug nest.”</p>

<p>“If Case would only shoot!” Jule hinted,
disliking the idea of a night there, “I could find my
way to the river. Perhaps he will, after a time, for
he will be lonesome and anxious as soon as it gets
dark.”</p>

<p>But no signals came from the river, which seemed
a long ways off, and the boys, hovering under the
bark roof and listening to the patter of the drops
on the growths of the forest, began to wonder if
something hadn’t happened to the lad in the boat.</p>

<p>Presently a wind came up, blowing great guns,
and the boys were obliged to cling tight to the
swaying ridge-pole of their tent in order to prevent
the whole frail habitation being blown away. It
looked as if a dreary night lay ahead of them.</p>

<p>After an hour or more had been passed in this
way a faint drumming, whirring sound was heard,
followed by a sharp whistle and a splash of paddles.</p>

<p>“That’s Frank’s miracle!—a steamboat on the
river!” cried Alex, jumping out into the rain.
“Now I reckon we can tell which way to go to the
<i>Rambler</i>!”</p>

<p>Clay and Jule arose and peered out in the
direction from which the sounds appeared to come.
Frank burst into a laugh.</p>

<p>“Look the other way!” he cried. “That is the
echo! The sound is stopped by the foliage and
hurled back.”</p>

<p>“Not!” disputed Jule. “The boat is off that
way. I can see a light over there.”</p>

<p>“If you do,” Frank returned, “you see a
campfire. The river lies off in the opposite direction.”</p>

<p>“We’ll see when the boat gets nearer,” Clay
conciliated. “If I had my way about it now, I should
chase off in the direction those sounds come from.”</p>

<p>The lads crept back under shelter and listened
patiently as the sounds came nearer. Then music
was heard. It was evidently a large passenger
steamer, and a lady was playing and singing in the
cabin!</p>

<p>“Sounds like a bit of paradise!” declared Clay.
“It has been a long time since we have heard a
woman sing.”</p>

<p>“Her song points out our way,” Alex observed,
as the lights of the boat struck the green, wet foliage
and flashed back a thousand tiny stars!</p>

<p>“Give it up?” asked Frank, as the steamer
passed and the lights and music faded in the
distance. “Give it up? You would have gotten
deeper into the woods if you had followed that
echo.”</p>

<p>The rain was now coming down harder than ever,
and the wind was blowing a perfect hurricane from
the west. Clay stepped out of the shelter and was
nearly blown off his feet.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” he said, bracing himself against
the wind,” we can make it if we try hard enough.
We know where to go now.”</p>

<p>“Dark?” Jule broke in, savagely. “Who said it
was dark?”</p>

<p>“No one!” scoffed Alex. “That isn’t a dark
jungle out there! That is the Great White Way!”</p>

<p>“You’re crazy!” Jule laughed. “Who said
there were snakes and jaguars in the woods of
Ecuador?”</p>

<p>“Who’s crazy now?” chanted Alex. “Give my
regards to Herald Square.”</p>

<p>“I believe you are both afraid to make the
journey back to the boat,” Clay laughed. “Hence these
meaningless observations.”</p>

<p>“Who’s afraid?” demanded Jule.</p>

<p>The next instant he was out in the rain, his
flashlight shining in front of him like a headlight to a
locomotive. When the others called out to him to
wait a second and give them the benefit of his light,
there was no reply. Nettled at the seeming taunt,
he had started off alone toward the <i>Rambler</i>.</p>

<p>It was dark, and the rain fell in torrents, and the
wind was tipping over great trees in the forest, but
the boys started out toward the river hoping to come
upon Jule with his searchlight before long.</p>

<p>Presently they saw it, coming toward them
through the trees, and then they heard the boy’s
voice, raised to a great pitch to combat the clamor
of the wind and rain.</p>

<p>“I’ve found the <i>Rambler</i>,” he said, “but Case
isn’t there!”</p>

<p>“Nice quiet excursion this,” said Alex, with an
answering whoop.</p>
 </div>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chXXII'>CHAPTER XXII.—A BATH IN THE NIGHT</h2>

<p class='first'>“A nice, quiet excursion, all right!” agreed
Clay. “This is one of Frank’s nature-loving
trips!”</p>

<p>“I wish I had some of these wild animals in
Lincoln park!” Alex grumbled. “I could live like
a king on the income they’d bring as promoters of
sensations!”</p>

<p>“There are said to be plenty of snakes along
North Clark street,” laughed Clay.</p>

<p>“But most of them are not present to the senses,”
Alex explained.</p>

<p>Jule came up with his light, and better progress
was made through the forest, which grew thinner
as it approached the river. The rain was still
falling in dashes, but the wind seemed to be going
down.</p>

<p>After walking a short distance they heard a call,
seemingly coming from the wrack of clouds overhead.</p>

<p>“That was Case’s voice!” Clay declared. “He’s
near by!”</p>

<p>“Sure it was!” Jule agreed, “but where is he?
Sounds like he was up in a balloon.”</p>

<p>Again the call came, and this time there was no
doubt that the boy was up above the surface of the
ground.</p>

<p>“He’s in a tree!” Clay concluded. “Now,
what do you think of that? This surely is a night
for nature-loving kids!”</p>

<p>“H-e-l-l-o!” called Case. “Lookout where you
go. I’ve got a whole menagerie down there.”</p>

<p>The boys stood still and looked about, passing
the searchlight from side to side, but seeing nothing
save the splash of the rain on the broad leaves about
them. Then Case called again:</p>

<p>“Keep close to the light!” he cried.</p>

<p>Then a great racket in the undergrowth reached
the ears of the listening lads. It sounded as if an
elephant was engaged in deadly combat with an
alligator fresh from the river. Cries like those of a
cat and grunts like those of a huge hog came with
the tumblings. Ripping sounds like tearing tough
cloth or leather succeeded. Presently the racket
died out, and nothing was heard save the drip-drip
of the rain and the wind in the tall trees. The night
was clearing a bit, and the clouds responsible for
the shower were breaking and floating away,
showing open spaces from which stars looked down.</p>

<p>A movement in the bushes caused Clay to present
his gun in that direction and Jule to advance his
light. Instead of the wild beast they anticipated
seeing. Case came forward to meet them. His
clothing was torn, and his face showed contact with
thorny vines.</p>

<p>“What did you leave the boat for?” demanded
Alex, glad of an opportunity to “roast” the boy.
“Someone might have carried it away in a hand-bag!”</p>

<p>“I wanted to get that jaguar skin,” was the
answer.</p>

<p>“Did you get it?” asked Jule, anxiously, for it
was the desire of his heart that the party should
take home such a trophy.</p>

<p>“Something got it, I guess,” replied Case. “Go
and look where that fight was. “You’ll see what I
bumped up against.”</p>

<p>Frank took the searchlight and peered through
the thicket to the spot where the disturbance had
been.</p>

<p>“It was a jaguar, all right,” he said, “and the
tamandua got him—and he got the tamandua.
Come here, boys.”</p>

<p>On the ground, clasped in a deadly embrace, lay
a tamandua and a jaguar. The tamandua is best
known as the ant-eater, and is a tough-skinned,
slothful animal, bulky, muscular, and dangerous when
attacked.</p>

<p>“I was stalking the jaguar,” Case said,
approaching the bodies, “when he turned on me. I didn’t
know what to do, so I mounted a tree, which was
some climb—believe me! Then the ant-eater blundered
along, and it looked as if the tiger was so mad
because he had been delayed in getting me that he
attacked the fellow. And there they lie! My, but
they kept each other busy for a spell.”</p>

<p>“The jaguar would have kept you busy if the ant-eater
hadn’t happened along!” Frank declared.
“He would have been up that tree in no time. You
are lucky to be alive!”</p>

<p>The boys found their way back to the <i>Rambler</i>
and delighted the heart of Alex by beginning
preparations for supper. Clay decided that they should
have a “native” meal, as a fowl shot earlier in the
afternoon would form the piece d’ resistance.
Besides the fowl, which was roasted at a fire on the
shore—alligators paddling about the shore and
slapping the water and the sand with their unwieldy
tails as the roasting went on—they had bread made
of the product of the mandioca plant. This plant
means as much to the people of Brazil as the potato
does to the inhabitants of our Northern states.</p>

<p>It produces farina, cassava, and tapioca, all of
which are made from the roots, which are peeled
like potatoes. In order to produce most of the
products of the plant the pulp secured from the roots
is squeezed dry by twisting it in a bag. The juice
thus secured is poisonous when new, but when
fermented it makes the whisky of the Amazon valley.</p>

<p>The boys also had a fish fresh from the river, and
Jule insisted on having this roasted also. Even the
coffee they had brought in with them was a product
of Brazil.</p>

<p>After supper they sat for a long time watching
the moon rise over the river. It came out of a bank
of clouds at first, but directly a long, bright path
lay along the rippling surface of the water, seeming
to lead straight back to the Atlantic coast.
Alligators innumerable came out and raced clumsily
about—playing, Frank said. Off in the forest they
could hear the call of a jaguar, probably the mate
of the one that had been killed by the ant-eater.</p>

<p>A great chattering in the trees told of the
presence of monkeys, but the boys did not molest them.
The alligators, too, were immune from the guns of
the party. The only thing the lads killed
relentlessly, at all times and under all circumstances, was
the snake.</p>

<p>“I move,” Clay began, as they all sat under the
wire netting, looking out on the attractive and
unfamiliar scene, “that we go on to Cloud island in
the morning and do our exploring when we come
down. I have a notion that this Lewiso and the
Englishmen will do murder up there unless we stifle
their cause of combat by taking the gold ourselves.”</p>

<p>“I second the motion!” Case cried.</p>

<p>Case was really becoming one of the most
enthusiastic and resourceful members of the party.
Only at rare intervals did he give way to his
imagination—an imagination, by the way, which was
bright and suggestive, even if inclined to bring out
disagreeable points—and let out prophecies of evil.</p>

<p>“I shall be glad when it is all over with,” Frank
admitted. “Of course I want you boys to have all
the fun you can on this trip, but I think we can have
better entertainment after this suspense is over, on
the way back to the coast.”</p>

<p>“Are you going back with us?” asked Alex.</p>

<p>“Yes; if you will permit it. Why not?”</p>

<p>“Even if we do not get the gold?”</p>

<p>“Why, certainly. If we get the gold I shall go
out with you as a starter on a series of travels to
include all the large rivers in the United States. If
we do not get it, why, then I shall have to go out
and find something to do.”</p>

<p>“Is this prospect of the gold all the interest you
have up there?” asked Clay.</p>

<p>“Yes, nearly all; my father left considerable
property, but it is about gone. My guardian helped
himself, and this Lewiso has cost me a lot of money.”</p>

<p>“Then we’ve just got to get the gold!” Alex
exclaimed. “We just can’t go back to Chicago
broke!”</p>

<p>“I like that idea of exploring all the large rivers
of the country,” Clay said, smiling at Alex’s
enthusiasm. “If we win out with the gold, we’ll form
a Motor Boat Club and make it our business to visit
all the large streams our Uncle Sam owns.”</p>

<p>“Correct!” shouted Alex.</p>

<p>“You know it!” Jule contributed.</p>

<p>“Glorious!” Case declared.</p>

<p>The boys talked until midnight, looking over the
moonlit river and listening, at intervals to the
sounds of the jungle.</p>

<p>“It is just like a large city!” Case observed.
“There is such a continuous clamor that individual
noises are lost. We hear only the full-throated roar
of races and forget the existence of the little
voices. But the little voices are there. They make
the roar!”</p>

<p>“We’ll all make a roar about getting up in the
morning!” Jule said, “if we don’t get to bed.”</p>

<p>He looked about the crowded deck where so many
hammocks swung and then up to the roof of the
cabin.</p>

<p>“I wonder,” he mused, “if the mosquitos would
eat me up before morning if I should make a bed
up on the cabin?”</p>

<p>“They would do their best!” Alex replied.</p>

<p>“Anyway,” Jule decided, “I’m going to try it.”</p>

<p>So he hauled a rug and a blanket to the roof of
the cabin and composed himself to slumber. The
boys on the deck were asleep almost as soon as he
was, and the alligators in the Amazon sported on
without a human audience.</p>

<p>But the long silence of the boat seemed to attract
the attention of the huge reptiles, and they soon
began to nose about the sides of the <i>Rambler</i>. Pretty
soon a whole school of the big fellows were
swimming close to the sides, evidently attracted by the
odor of the supper which had been eaten there.</p>

<p>Presently a huge fellow bunted into another huge
fellow in what seemed to be defiance of the rules of
river etiquette, and a battle was the result. In the
squabble one was forced with a bunt against the
boat, and the craft rocked perilously. Another
bunt, and the top of the cabin stood at an angle of
about 75 degrees. The sleeper rolled off his blanket
and tumbled overboard, striking one of the fighters
squarely on the nose.</p>

<p>The alligators seemed to be as much surprised at
the sudden visitation as Jule was to find himself
floundering in the water, with the cold noses of
the ’gators touching his bare flesh. He let out a cry
which brought the boys out of their hammocks with
their guns in their hands, and directly a shower of
lead fell into the river.</p>

<p>When the boy was finally pulled on deck he looked
at both legs and both arms, and felt of the back of
his head to see if he was all there. Alex tried to
convince him that one of the river “birds” had
amputated his intelligence, but Jule chased him away
and lay down on his blanket again.</p>

<p>“You’re a nice fisherman!” Case cried. “Trying
to catch an alligator by the tail! We’ll have to
tie you up!”</p>

<p>Even Captain Joe seemed to be inclined to laugh
at the lad for his accident, but quiet was soon
restored, and the boat was sent up the river at great
speed, Jule declaring that he would sit up and run
her in order to get out of that part of the country.
Its snakes and alligators, he intimated, were too
numerous for him!</p>

<p>For two days and nights they kept on their way,
stopping once to replenish their gasoline tanks.
Then, on the morning of the third day, a cloud lifted
from the river and Frank pointed to it with a sigh
of relief. As he did so the wreck of a steamer
floated past—a steamer which had been the <i>Señorita</i>,
and which had evidently been blown up with
dynamite. What had taken place, the boys asked,
and where was the crew?</p>
 </div>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chXXIII'>CHAPTER XXIII.—CLOUD ISLAND</h2>

<p class='first'>Cloud Island was just a bulk of mist when the
lads came opposite it. The outlines of the shore
were not to be seen, for steam pouring out of the
fissures in the rocks clouded everything. To the
west, however, a small hut was to be seen on the
narrow rim which lay between the river and the
mountains. While they looked, checking the speed
of the <i>Rambler</i> until it just held against the
current, two figures moved out of the structure and
motioned to the boat.</p>

<p>“That’s John!” Frank cried, putting his fingers
to his lips and giving out a long, wavering whistle
which cut the air like a knife. “That is John,” he
went on—“the man I left in charge of my affairs
here. I think we would better land at the little pier
just above.”</p>

<p>But there was no pier there, only a mass of burned
and twisted timbers and blackened stones!
However, Frank put ashore in the row-boat, soon
returning with the man who had motioned from the shore.
He was a muscular young fellow with the dusky
complexion of the native Indian and the regular
features of the American. He was dressed in
European clothing and spoke English fluently,
although Frank assured his friends that he had never
lived out of Peru.</p>

<p>It was evident that Frank and John had discussed
personal affairs on the way to the deck of the
<i>Rambler</i>, for the boy now asked:</p>

<p>“What happened to the pier?”</p>

<p>The boys gathered around to hear the reply, for
the wreck which had drifted by them told of
violence which had not been confined to the boat.</p>

<p>“Before we go into that,” John replied, “suppose
you head up to the station just above—where your
father used to live—and bring down a surgeon. I
have two patients at my hut.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you tell me that before?” asked
Frank.</p>

<p>“I thought you might want to stop and talk with
them,” was the reply, “and every minute is precious
if their lives are to be saved.”</p>

<p>“Who are they?” asked Clay, unable to longer
restrain his curiosity.</p>

<p>Frank’s eyes asked the same question, and John
continued:</p>

<p>“You remember Lord Wilson? The Englishman
who came here with a valet two years ago?
Well, one of the men in need of surgical aid is
Edward, the valet. He came in here a few days ago
with another Englishman, in a queer combination
of launch and motor boat.”</p>

<p>“Ahead of the <i>Señorita</i>?” asked Frank.</p>

<p>“Just behind her. This man Lewiso, who formerly
worked for your father, was in charge of the
<i>Señorita</i>, and the two men mixed at once. You
see,” he added with a smile, “they were both after
the gold we have so often talked about, and each
believed that the other knew the exact location of it.
They both prowled about Cloud island, each watching
the other, until they came to blows.”</p>

<p>“That was to have been expected,” Frank said.</p>

<p>“The crew of the <i>Señorita</i> deserted when shooting
began, and Lewiso and Edward had it out together,
one day, on the pier, where the <i>Señorita</i> lay.
Neither was much injured, but that night the
steamer was blown out of water with dynamite
stolen from my warehouse. I pushed the wreck of
the vessel down stream not long ago.”</p>

<p>“We just passed it.”</p>

<p>“The companion of the Englishman, Edward,
was killed that night, but Lewiso escaped. Last
night they came together—Edward and Lewiso—on
Cloud island, while searching for the gold, and this
morning my men brought them to my place wounded
unto death. They are there now, and the doctor’s
house is in sight, and we’ll interrupt the conversation
long enough to get him on board,” John added, as
the motor boat headed in at a little cove on the west
shore.</p>

<p>The doctor was soon on board—a fussy little fellow
with gray hair and a beard like a goat—and the
<i>Rambler</i> shot down stream again.</p>

<p>“Of course the men never found what they were
looking for?” asked Frank, as the boat sped on its
way.</p>

<p>“Certainly not, and for a very good reason!”</p>

<p>“Not being able to find the right cavern, I
suppose?” laughed Frank.</p>

<p>“Oh, they found the right cavern, all right, but
that helped them not a bit.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>Frank sprang to his feet excitedly, and the others
gathered around, anticipating the next sentence.
There had been no gold in the cavern! Frank’s
father had been mistaken! Was that what John was
about to say? Had all this excitement, all these
dreams of wealth, come to such a dreary ending?</p>

<p>“There was no gold there for them to get!” John
said.</p>

<p>Frank sank back with a sigh.</p>

<p>“That is a corker!” he said. “No gold there?”</p>

<p>“For the reason,” continued John, with a laugh,
“that I had taken it out and shipped it away!”</p>

<p>Clay was about to ask the speaker if he considered
it a good joke to rob a fellow like that and then laugh
over it, but there was so much humor in John’s eyes
that he hesitated to put the impertinent, accusing
and degrading question.</p>

<p>Frank arose wearily and walked away, but John
caught him by the arm and turned him back.</p>

<p>“When we get up to the hut,” he said, “I’ll show
you how much I got for the gold. It was sold at
Para, at a small discount.”</p>

<p>Frank did not appear at all interested in the price
of this gold—the gold he had considered his own.</p>

<p>“All right!” he said, dully. “Then we’ll turn
back.”</p>

<p>“Not until you look over the island,” cried Alex.
“I’ve a notion that there’s something crooked
been going on here, and I want to remain here-abouts
long enough to dig it out,” he continued,
his eyes flashing in John’s direction. John did not
appear to mind this in the least, and even Captain
Joe seemed to make light of the hostile demonstration,
for he sniffed a moment at John’s trousers and
then, taking him into his confidence lay down at his
feet!</p>

<p>“You must have made a good thing off Frank’s
gold!” Jule broke in.</p>

<p>“Something like $300,000,” was the cool reply.</p>

<p>“That’s nice!” cried Case, moving toward the
speaker.</p>

<p>“And the check for it all,” John went on,
laughing as he talked, “is waiting for Frank! It was his
mine, you know, and if he wants to pay me for my
trouble, why——”</p>

<p>An avalanche of boys flowed over John! They
dragged him about the deck, tore at his clothes,
shouted his name——</p>

<p>“John! John! John! He’s a brick is John!”</p>

<p>“Here’s for a revel! Bring him along! Who?
John!”</p>

<p>“That will answer for the present,” John managed
to say. “Save the pieces! I want to see a little
of the world yet!”</p>

<p>It took a long time for John to describe how the
cavern had been opened by himself, and how he had
engaged men to work the gold out during the night-time,
and how it had been secretly shipped away,
and how all the money it brought lay at Frank’s
disposal in a bank at Para!</p>

<p>But the story was told at last, and then the <i>Rambler</i>
landed the surgeon and all went up to John’s hut
to see the two men who had fought each other for an
empty cavern! John’s servant opened the door for
them and pointed silently to two bunks standing next
the wall. The figures on the bunks were still, and
a white cloth was laid over each face.</p>

<p>The boys turned away and went back to the
<i>Rambler</i>. And so the quest for the Cloud island
gold ended, and so the secret of Cloud island was
told.</p>

<p>The boys remained a week at Cloud island, and
then, accompanied by John, started back down the
Amazon. Before leaving, Frank gave to John what
was left of his father’s estate, and the latter refused
to accept any other reward for getting out the gold.
The honest fellow had long ago been taken into the
confidence of Frank’s father in the matter of the
gold, and so it was, after all, no great wonder that
he had found it!</p>

<p>His idea in not acquainting Frank with the true
condition of affairs before the boy left for Chicago,
was that the boy ought to go about a bit and learn
the value of money before taking such wealth into
his boyish hands.</p>

<p>Then followed more magnificent days and nights
on the Amazon. The boys were now in the midst
of the wet season on the upper river, and many of
the camps they had made on the way up were under
water. However, the <i>Rambler</i> behaved admirably,
and Captain Joe seemed so proud of her conduct in
the face of the flood that he was always found
looking over the stern with an air of dignity and
triumph!</p>

<p>And so, with Jule completely restored to health,
the boys stepped out on the pier on the South Branch
one sharp day in early winter. And who should be
there but Captain Joe, with his ruddy face and
wooden leg! The dog immediately made friends
with him, of course, and, in order that names might
not become mixed, was called merely “Joe” as long
as the boys remained in the city.</p>

<p>When they set foot on the pier that first day Clay
turned to Frank and seized him by the neck, in mock
anger.</p>

<p>“Tell me!” he cried. “Tell me who put the
marked newspaper on the boat that morning!”</p>

<p>“I did,” was the calm reply. “You see,” the boy
continued, “those were my diamonds, and——”</p>

<p>“And you paid the reward!”</p>

<p>“I pledged the stones to the lawyer to get the
money to pay that reward!” laughed Frank.</p>

<p>It was so noisy for a time, on account of what
the boys were saying and doing to Frank, that
nothing more was said. Then Clay:</p>

<p>“But the diamonds were stolen?”</p>

<p>“Stolen by a lad who had slept with me in a cheap
lodging house on Clark street,” was the reply.
“You see, I had kept the stones, even when hungry
and cold, because they had been the last gift of my
mother. When they were stolen I followed the track
of the thief until I came to this dock, where we had
often loitered together before. As it turned out, the
boy had repented of his act, and was here to return
the stones to me, he believing that I would come here
to watch your boat, as we had done together many a
night. But Lewiso—whose name was Lewis, by the
way—saw him have the gems and fought him for
them. He secured them and ran away, as you know,
before I could interfere or find breath to follow him.
Well, you saved the diamond, and the next morning
I arranged for the reward to come to you. I guess
you know all the rest.”</p>

<p>“Not yet!” broke in Captain Joe. “There is a
matter of $300, you know!”</p>

<p>“But you gave that, Captain!”</p>

<p>The good-natured captain pointed to Frank.</p>

<p>“After he gave it to me and told me what to do
with it.”</p>

<p>Then followed another demonstration which it is
not necessary to describe! Everything had been
explained save the robbery of the boat that night, and
that would never be anything but a mystery.</p>

<p>One of the first men to call on the boys was Dr.
Holcomb, who made a great claim for damages on
his boat! But he was appeased when he saw how
well Jule looked, and offered the boat for another
river trip. Finally he called Jule aside and whispered:</p>

<p>“Did you tell them?”</p>

<p>Jule shook his head and Clay called out:</p>

<p>“Tell them what?”</p>

<p>Again the boys gathered around to hear a story
told.</p>

<p>“The day before you left,” the doctor began, “I
found a little property which belonged to Jule. You
see, his parents had owned a lot out on Cottage
Grove avenue, and it had increased in value. Jule,
it seems, had been paying the taxes without knowing
it, for the tenant of the place had paid the claims for
taxes and improvements and put the rest of the rent
money in bank. He did not know that Jule’s
father was dead, but expected him back any day to
demand an accounting. I told Jule about it that
night, and kept him quite a long time doing it!”</p>

<p>“Can’t you dig up a fortune for Alex and Clay
now?” asked Case. “I would just enjoy being the
only poor one in the bunch. I’ve cut out the
prophet-of-evil business, and that is enough for me for one
year.”</p>

<p>“This property belongs to us all,” Jule cried.
“At least the income from it does, and right here
we’ll form the Six Rivers Motor Boat Club and get
ready for a trip in the spring.”</p>

<p>“Where?” asked the doctor.</p>

<p>“The Colorado?” hinted Alex.</p>

<p>“The Mississippi,” said Jule.</p>

<p>“The St. Lawrence,” declared Case.</p>

<p>“The Ohio,” Clay suggested.</p>

<p>“Or the Columbia!” Frank mentioned.</p>

<p>“That’s it!” they all cried. “The Columbia!
And a larger boat, and no gold caverns, and no
snakes!” added Jule.</p>

<p>The story of the adventures of the boys at the
headwaters of the Columbia will be found in the
second volume of the Six-River Motor Boat Club
Series, entitled: “Motor Boat Boys on the
Columbia; or, the Confession of a Photograph.”</p>
